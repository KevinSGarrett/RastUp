HEADLESS RUN -- DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS.

Task: Implement WBS-1.3 knowledge plumbing & control plane.

Context:
- docs/blueprints/* contains technical and non-technical project blueprints.
- scripts/blueprints/build_index.py produces docs/index/{manifest.json, chunks.jsonl, segments.jsonl}.
- Agents must be able to read both tech and non-tech docs; orchestrator should expose a small CLI.

Deliverables:
1) Ensure/Update orchestrator/knowledge.py with subcommands:
   - build: rebuild indexes if needed (delegate to scripts/blueprints/build_index.py).
   - audit --strict: verify docs/index/manifest.json and segments.jsonl exist; print JSON result.
   - query --text "..." --k N: return top-N hits across normalized knowledge.
   - read/show: convenience readers for raw/normalized content.

2) Add scripts/smoke/smoke.ps1 and scripts/smoke/smoke.sh to run a minimal end-to-end query (idempotent).

3) Add/verify .github/workflows/ci-knowledge.yml to gate presence of knowledge artifacts and basic audit pass.

4) Respect SAFE-MODE: if ops/flags/safe-mode.json exists, avoid destructive actions; only read and report.

5) If a tool is missing (docx/odf/pypdf), scaffold steps with TODO and continue-on-error: true in CI.

6) Keep the diff PR-sized and additive; do not break existing workflows.

Staging & Commit:
- Stage only new/updated files related to knowledge plumbing and smoke.
- Commit message:
  orchestrator: WBS-1.3 knowledge plumbing & control plane
  NT-1.3
  TD-1.3
  WBS-1.3

Hint (optional focus from user query):
orchestrator knowledge indexing approvals safe-mode slack

Finally, print exactly:
DONE
