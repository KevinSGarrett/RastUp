if you feel like we've fully covered everything for this sub-section with 100% confidence and 100% guarantee in full detail that it covers the full scope of the non technical project plan files then we can proceed. If not then expand on the current sub-section until everything has been covered in full detail with 100% confidence and also ensure that there are no missing gaps in the sub-section that need to be addressed or filled in. 

Non technical project files and suggested modules files have also been re-attached to ensure you're able to access them

I have also re-uploaded the non-technical project files as well just in case but please continue the hard rule of informing me if the non technical project files or suggested modules file have expired or not with every reply
