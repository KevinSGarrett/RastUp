## **1.14.G Safety, policy, and moderation**

- **IDV**: creators and fans must be 18+ verified before accessing Fan‑Sub surfaces.

- **Content rules**:

  - Prohibit illegal content, doxxing, hate, non‑consensual content.
  - For public previews, **SFW only**; NSFW allowed in finals if compliant and user’s Safe‑Mode is OFF.

- **Moderation pipeline**: previews are scanned (image/video); text captions pass toxicity/PII checks; repeat violations trigger T&S review and potential suspension.

- **Anticircumvention**: block emails/phones in captions and messages; nudges and soft blocks escalate on repeat.

- **Reporting**: fans can report content; T&S console handles takedowns and refunds.

- **DMCA**:

  - Inbound claims queue → temporarily hide content; notify creator; counter‑notice process handled via Admin console.
  - Evidence stored (timestamps, hashes from manifest).
  - We do not provide legal advice; the tooling facilitates compliance.
