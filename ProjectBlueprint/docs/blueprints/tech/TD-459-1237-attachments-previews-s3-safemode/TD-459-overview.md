## **1.23.7 Attachments & Previews (S3 + Safe‑Mode)**

- **Direct‑to‑S3** presigned PUTs; client‑side resize; max size/polices from §1.18.G.
- **Virus/NSFW scans** on ingest; thumbnails stored; raw files retained per user choice (privacy).
- **Safe‑Mode:** previews in **inbox list** and **message bubbles** are SFW thumbnails when Safe‑Mode is ON; full‑res only after user opts into Safe‑Mode OFF + verified age. This follows public‑surface policy but applies to messaging previews too.
