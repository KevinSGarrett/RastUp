### **K.1 Purpose & invariants**

- **Change Orders** modify scope before the session starts (e.g., additional deliverables, time shift).
- **Overtime** is an in‑session or post‑session extension beyond the booked end time.
- All changes are tracked as immutable **amendment lines**; the original booking price snapshot remains unchanged.
- Taxes are **re‑quoted per leg** for each amendment that affects taxable amount.
- Payments for positive deltas are collected immediately (card incremental capture if available; otherwise a new PaymentIntent). For ACH, create a **second** PaymentIntent.
