## **1.6.A Canon & invariants**

558. **IDV is prerequisite** for: (a) **Instant Book**, (b) **18+ media gating** (e.g., Fan-sub role visibility), and (c) **elevated trust ranking** in search.
559. **BG checks (FCRA)** are **optional**; passing BG grants the **Trusted Pro** badge and additional ranking/eligibility boosts.
560. **Badges are scoped to the Account** (user), but **search boosts and gates are applied per Service Profile**.
561. **No raw PII is stored** from providers; we store tokens/refs and statuses only.
562. **Adverse action** workflows (for BG) are handled via standardized templates and cooling-off periods.
563. **All trust decisions are auditable**; Admin actions require reasons; sensitive overrides use two-person approval.
