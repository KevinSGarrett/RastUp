### **M.1 Contract**

- After session end, buyer gets an **acceptance window** (e.g., 48h) to confirm satisfactory completion.
- If accepted → **queue payouts** immediately. If no response → **auto‑accept** at deadline.
- If buyer reports issue within the window → open a **dispute** or **resolution ticket**; payouts are **paused** for that leg pending outcome.
