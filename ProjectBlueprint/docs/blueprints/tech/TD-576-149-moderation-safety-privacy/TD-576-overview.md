## **1.4.9 Moderation, Safety & Privacy**

- **Block/Report** UI on every thread; block prevents new gates; report opens a T&S case (Admin access is **case‑bound**).
- **Safe‑Mode images**: SFW previews only; NSFW/unsafe media blocked or blurred with label when policy demands.
- **PII**: exact addresses, phone, and studio door codes never appear in public; they appear in **booking detail** context only.
