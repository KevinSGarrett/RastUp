## **1.24.1 Objectives & Scope**

- **Public listing pages** showing: **Quick Facts** (size, ceiling height, daylight orientation, power), **Amenities** chips, **Rules & Policies**, **Availability** (hourly slots with min hours and buffers), **Pricing** (per‑hour, cleaning fee, examples), **Host** stats, **Location** (approximate map only, exact address released post‑booking), and **Reviews**.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Booking Widget** that enforces min hours/buffers, collects crew size, attaches Smart Docs (Property/Space Release + House Rules) to checkout, supports **deposit holds**, and differentiates **Instant Book** vs **Request to book**.

NonTechBlueprint

- **Host Create/Edit Wizard & Dashboard**: content, amenities, rules, pricing/schedule, IB toggle, deposit settings, verification, calendar ops, ICS export, and post‑booking adjustments (overtime/crew overage/violations).

NonTechBlueprint

- **Reviews & Reputation (space‑scoped)** with owner reply, filters, and reputation breakdowns; signals flow to Search (§1.21).

NonTechBlueprint

- **Cross‑module links**: “**Pair with Talent**” chips prefilter People search for the same date/city (deep‑link).
