## **1.2.O Security, privacy, safety controls**

- **Safe‑Mode** enforced at query and render time.
- **Age‑gate** required to see certain role tabs (Fan‑Sub); explicit public images still disallowed.
- **PII** never stored in index documents.
- **Abuse**: aggressive rate limiting and bot heuristics for suggest endpoints.
