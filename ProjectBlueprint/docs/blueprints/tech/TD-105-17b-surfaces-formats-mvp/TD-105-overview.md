## **1.7.B Surfaces & formats (MVP)**

- **Role search results** (people): boostable cards (same card template with a “Promoted” chip).
- **Studio search results** (places): enabled later behind a flag—same transparency rules.
- **No feed/native content** placements at MVP; keep to search and browse only.

**Formats (MVP):**

- **Featured**: occupies specific reserved slots (e.g., positions 2 and 8) when eligible; rotates fairly among eligible campaigns.
- **Boosted**: appears interleaved at set intervals after position *P* (e.g., after every 5 organic results).

Both formats **never override filters** and **never** show if the candidate doesn’t qualify for that query.
