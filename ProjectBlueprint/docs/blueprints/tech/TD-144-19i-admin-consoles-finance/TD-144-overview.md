## **1.9.I Admin consoles (Finance)**

- **Fees & taxes**: fee rules by city/role; dry‑run previews on example legs; dual‑approval for rule changes.
- **Wallet**: credit/debit/adjustment tools with reason; hard caps for goodwill per admin.
- **GL & recon**: daily close board (tie‑in to §1.3.V), variance tiles, drill‑down to *gl_entry* and Stripe balance txn ids.
- **MoR toggle** (city gate): determines whether service taxes go to Seller Payable or Tax Payable.
- **Exports**: GL CSV, statements batch, tax reports.
- **Audits**: every money‑affecting admin action logged with before/after and two‑person approval when required.
