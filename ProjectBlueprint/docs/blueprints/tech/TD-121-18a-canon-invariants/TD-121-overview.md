## **1.8.A Canon & invariants**

730. **Scope is sacred.** Reviews for **Service Profiles (SPs)** and **Studios** are separate. No cross-pollination.
731. **Eligibility to review:** Only the **buyer** on a **completed leg** (or auto-accepted group) can review that **leg’s counterparty**.
732. **One review per leg per author**, editable once within a short window (e.g., 24 h), then locked.
733. **Star + text + structured facets** (e.g., communication, timeliness, quality, cleanliness for studios).
734. **Abuse controls**: block self-reviews, ring patterns, retaliatory bursts, hate speech, doxxing.
735. **Display rules**: recent-weighted average with minimum sample guard; show distributions and recent highlights.
736. **Appeals & moderation**: content policy applies; T&S can remove/restore with immutable audits.
