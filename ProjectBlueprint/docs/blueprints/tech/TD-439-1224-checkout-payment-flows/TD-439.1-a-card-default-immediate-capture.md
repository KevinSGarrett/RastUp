### **A) Card (default) — immediate capture**

2150. Create **Order (draft)** → compute totals (apply credit to buyer_fee before tax).
2151. Create **PaymentIntent** for *amount = subtotal + buyer_fee + tax − credit_applied*.
2152. Confirm PI (Stripe SDK or server) → on success, **capture now**; set order = *captured*.
2153. **Transfers** occur after completion (e.g., T+24h) or as per policy; platform fee retained.
