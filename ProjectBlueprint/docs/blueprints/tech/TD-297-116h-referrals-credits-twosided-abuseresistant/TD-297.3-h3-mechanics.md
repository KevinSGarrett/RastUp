### **H.3 Mechanics**

- **Invite flow** issues signed links that encode *program_id* and inviter; capture device/IP on accept.
- **Qualification events**: “package published,” “brief posted,” “booking awarded/completed” feed a small **rules engine**; on pass, write **credit_ledger (award)**.
- **Clawback**: upon fraud/refund adjudication in §1.15/§1.9, write **credit_ledger (clawback)** and revoke unused credits.
