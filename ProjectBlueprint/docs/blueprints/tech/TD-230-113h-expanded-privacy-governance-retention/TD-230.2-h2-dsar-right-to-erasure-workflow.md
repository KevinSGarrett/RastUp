### **H.2 DSAR (Right to Erasure) workflow**

1378. **User request** creates *dsar.requested* admin ticket and writes a **tombstone event**:  
      *{ event: "dsar.tombstone", v:1, user_id:"usr\_...", occurred_at:… }*.

1379. **Operational stores** (Aurora/Dynamo/S3 app buckets) execute deletion/redaction per policy (already covered in §§1.4–1.12).

1380. Analytics purge:

      10. **Silver/Gold**: nightly job reads tombstones and deletes/overwrites partitions where *user_id=usr\_…* or *actor_key* links; regenerate affected aggregates.
      11. **Bronze**: keep immutable; **exclude on read** by maintaining *dsar_exclusions* table joined in views (regulatory‑approved strategy).

1381. **Verification**: generate a DSAR purge report with table counts before/after; store PDF in legal hold S3.

**Legal hold**: blocked DSARs write *dsar.hold* and the purge job skips those users until hold clears.
