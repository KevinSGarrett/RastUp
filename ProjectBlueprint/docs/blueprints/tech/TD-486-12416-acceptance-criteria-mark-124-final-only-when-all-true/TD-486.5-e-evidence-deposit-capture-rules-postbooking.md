### **E) Evidence & Deposit Capture Rules (post‑booking)**

**Recommended path:** *spaces/policy/deposit-evidence.md*

*- Violations: overtime, crew overage, damage, cleaning breach, rule breach (smoking, open flame, etc.).*  
*- Evidence: photos/videos, timestamp, note; optional third-party invoice upload.*  
*- Workflow: host files adjustment → buyer has 72h to accept/contest → if unresponsive or rejected, T&S mediates; deposit capture only after mediation outcome = "approve capture".*  
*- Stripe integration: if deposit hold still valid, capture up to hold amount; else create additional charge with buyer consent or case-based platform escalation.*
