### **D) Host Cancellation Penalties & Reputation Impact**

**Recommended path:** *spaces/policy/host-cancel.md*

*- Penalty triggers: host-initiated cancellation after acceptance.*  
*- Actions: automatic buyer refund; host reputation decrease; platform fee waived; optional host fee penalty (% of subtotal) after N cancellations per quarter.*  
*- Search impact: temporary down-rank in Studios index; badge removed if cancellations persist.*  

**DDL note:** add *host_cancel_count_qtr* to *space_reputation* and a history table *space_host_cancellation*.
