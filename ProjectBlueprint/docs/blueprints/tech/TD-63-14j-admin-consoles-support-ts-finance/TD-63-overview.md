## **1.4.J Admin consoles (Support, T&S, Finance)**

- **Support**: view thread & panel, impersonate read‑only, run policy simulator, send system notices, approve/deny reschedules (if needed), manage refunds (hooks §1.3).
- **T&S**: moderation queue, content decisions, anticircumvention violations, mutes/blocks, audit exports.
- **Finance**: expenses rollups vs receipts; deposit claims queue; links to payouts/reserves pages.

All admin acts require reason and generate immutable audits; sensitive actions require **two‑person approval**.
