- **Booking issue** (people/studios)

  - *Pre‑event*: reschedule request, venue conflict, wrong filters.

  - *Post‑event*: quality dispute, late delivery, partial completion, damages (studio).

- Payment & payouts

  - Charge failure, duplicate charge, refund status, **instant payout** delay, verification hold.

- Product/Account

  - Access problems, comms/unsubscribe, trust badge concerns.

- DMCA/IP

  - Infringing media claims (Fan‑Sub or previews), counter‑notice tracking.

- Policy violation

  - Harassment, doxxing, off‑platform solicitation (anticircumvention), hate speech, illegal content.

- Chargeback (card network)
