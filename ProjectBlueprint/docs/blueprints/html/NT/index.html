<body>
<p>SubSection 1.1 — Role System Design</p>
<p>1) Core Concept: “Linked Service Profiles” under One Account</p>
<p>One account per person (single login, single identity).</p>
<p>Each account can attach one or more “Service Profiles” (SP) — one per
role:</p>
<p>Model SP</p>
<p>Photographer SP</p>
<p>Videographer SP</p>
<p>Content Creator SP</p>
<p>Each Service Profile is a self-contained, bookable offering with its
own:</p>
<p>Rolespecific fields (e.g., measurements vs. gear list)</p>
<p>Portfolio (images/videos assigned to that role)</p>
<p>Rates/packages &amp; availability</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; rating (per role)</p>
<p>Search index entry and URL</p>
<p>The Account has shared, global elements:</p>
<p>Display name, avatar, city/region, verification badges, background
check badge</p>
<p>Follower/following counts (global)</p>
<p>Unified inbox (roleaware threads)</p>
<p>Unified feed (posts can be tagged to one/more roles)</p>
<p>Favorites boards (can hold userlevel or rolelevel items)</p>
<p>Why: Treating each role as a distinct, bookable “Service Profile”
makes search and booking crystal clear while keeping life simple for
multirole users via one login and shared assets.</p>
<p>2) URLs &amp; Navigation</p>
<p>User overview: /u/{handle}<br />
Shows account header + tabs for each Service Profile (e.g., Model |
Photographer | Creator), global posts, and “About”.</p>
<p>Service Profile canonical pages:</p>
<p>Model: /u/{handle}/model</p>
<p>Photographer: /u/{handle}/photographer</p>
<p>Videographer: /u/{handle}/videographer</p>
<p>Creator: /u/{handle}/creator</p>
<p>Search results always link to the rolespecific page (not the account
overview) to keep context tight.<br />
Example: From “Model” search, clicking Jane goes to /u/jane/model. From
there, users can switch roles via tabs (“Also offers:
Photographer”).</p>
<p>3) Profile UI (What viewers see)</p>
<p>Header (shared)</p>
<p>Name, city, avatar, verification badges, backgroundcheck badge,
overall followers, quick actions (Message, Share, Report).</p>
<p>Role chips: Model | Photographer | Videographer | Creator (active
role highlighted).</p>
<p>Tabs (roleaware, contextual default):</p>
<p>Work (role portfolio) — grid/lightbox, role tags on media; NSFW
gating if applicable.</p>
<p>About (role fields) — e.g., for Model: height, measurements,
hair/eyes, categories; for Photographer: specialties, gear, software;
for Creator: platform links, verified follower counts, engagement
rate.</p>
<p>Rates &amp; Packages — hourly/day rates, packaged offers (e.g., “2hr
studio shoot w/ 10 edits”).</p>
<p>Availability — calendar, travel notes, response time.</p>
<p>Reviews — rolespecific (default to the role you’re viewing) with
toggle to view All Roles.</p>
<p>Posts — profile feed; filter chips to display posts from this role by
default.</p>
<p>Primary CTA (contextual):</p>
<p>On role pages: “Book {Role}” and “Message about {Role}”</p>
<p>On overview: disabled until a role is selected (or show a small role
selector popover).</p>
<p>4) RoleSpecific Data (Minimum Fields)</p>
<p>Model SP</p>
<p>Height, weight, measurements, dress/shoe size</p>
<p>Hair color, eye color, skin tone/ethnicity (selfascribed)</p>
<p>Categories (fashion, fitness, swim, glam, etc.)</p>
<p>Willingness: TFP/paid only; NSFW allowed? (if policy permits)</p>
<p>Base rates, travel radius/fees</p>
<p>Photographer SP</p>
<p>Specialties (portraits, fashion, boudoir, commercial, events)</p>
<p>Gear (camera bodies, lenses, lighting), studio access</p>
<p>Editing software/turnaround time</p>
<p>License/usage terms defaults (for contracts)</p>
<p>Base rates/packages</p>
<p>Videographer SP</p>
<p>Specialties (reels, music videos, events, product)</p>
<p>Equipment (cameras, gimbals, drones), editing tools</p>
<p>Deliverables (duration, formats), turnaround</p>
<p>Base rates/packages</p>
<p>Content Creator SP</p>
<p>Platforms (IG, TikTok, YT, OF, etc.) with verified follower counts
&amp; computed engagement rate (if integrations enabled)</p>
<p>Niche(s), audience geo %, age/gender splits (if available)</p>
<p>Promo formats offered (grid post, story, reel, live)</p>
<p>Base rates/packages</p>
<p>Notes: All SPs inherit shared basics (bio, location), but require
rolespecific fields to be indexed for search.</p>
<p>5) Search &amp; Discovery (CategoryFirst)</p>
<p>Search begins by selecting a category (role): Models | Photographers
| Videographers | Creators.</p>
<p>Home search bar has a leading role selector (defaults to last
used).</p>
<p>Each role has its own advanced filters (different fields, operators,
and ranges).</p>
<p>Indexing: Each Service Profile is a separate search document.</p>
<p>A multirole user appears once per relevant role (e.g., “Jane — Model”
and “Jane — Photographer” are distinct cards).</p>
<p>Result Cards (rolescoped):</p>
<p>Avatar, name, city, role label, role rating (e.g., ★4.9 • 32),
starting rate, key highlights per role (Models: height/measurements;
Creators: followers/engagement; Photographers: specialties),
verification badges.</p>
<p>Quick actions: Book, Message, Save to Board.</p>
<p>Subtext: “Also offers: Photographer” (clickable) — but doesn’t
pollute the current role results.</p>
<p>Saved searches &amp; alerts are rolescoped (e.g., “Models in Houston,
5'8+ fitness, $$/hour”).</p>
<p>6) Booking (RoleAnchored)</p>
<p>A booking is always tied to a Service Profile (the role being
hired).</p>
<p>Request flow: Date/time, location, brief, deliverables,
rate/packages; optional contract terms (usage rights, model release
template).</p>
<p>Calendar integration: One unified availability for the account;
bookings from any role block out time globally to prevent conflicts.</p>
<p>Rescheduling/cancellation apply to the rolebound booking, but time
blocking stays global.</p>
<p>7) Reviews &amp; Ratings (Clear &amp; Fair)</p>
<p>Only bookers can review. One review per completed booking.</p>
<p>Rolespecific ratings:</p>
<p>Each Service Profile has its own star rating and review list.</p>
<p>On the account header (and in search cards), show perrole ratings if
they exist (e.g., “Model ★4.9 (32) | Photographer ★4.6 (12)”).</p>
<p>Overall rating (optional/secondary): A weighted composite (by # of
reviews per role). Display lightly on the overview, never used in
rolespecific ranking.</p>
<p>Review visibility: Default to the role you’re viewing with a toggle
to see All Roles (clearly labeled).</p>
<p>Why: Keeps feedback relevant to the service hired while still showing
crossrole reputation if desired.</p>
<p>8) Messaging (Unified Inbox, RoleAware)</p>
<p>One inbox for the user, with smart organization:</p>
<p>Thread type: General Inquiry vs. Booking Thread #ID</p>
<p>Role context tag: e.g., Model, Photographer</p>
<p>Counterparty and project title/date</p>
<p>Status chips: New, Awaiting Reply, Payment Pending, Completed</p>
<p>Read receipts (✓ sent, ✓✓ read) with timestamps.</p>
<p>Filters &amp; folders: By role, by status (Unread, Awaiting
response), by city/date.</p>
<p>Thread merge policy:</p>
<p>Each booking always gets its own thread.</p>
<p>Prebooking inquiries by role are separate threads per role (prevent
confusion).</p>
<p>The inbox shows conversation bundles by counterpart (expand to see
rolespecific threads).</p>
<p>Attachments: Mood boards, references, call sheets.</p>
<p>Safety: Inline tips for firsttime connections; easy report/block.</p>
<p>Incentives (ties to verification; see §12): base monthly
newconversation credits + bonus credits for verified tiers. Bookings and
reply threads do not consume credits.</p>
<p>9) Portfolio &amp; Tagging (Per Role, Easy to Maintain)</p>
<p>Media Library (account level): upload once, then assign media to one
or more roles (checks).</p>
<p>Role Portfolios: Each SP has Albums (e.g., “Editorial”, “Fitness”).
Media show role tags and collaborator tags.</p>
<p>Tagging collaborators: Add other users to media with role credit
(e.g., “@Sam — Model”).</p>
<p>Approval queue for the tagged user; on approve, the media appears in
their Collaboration section (rolespecific).</p>
<p>NSFW controls (if allowed): mark media NSFW; hidden by default unless
viewer opts in.</p>
<p>Maintenance speed: Assigning media to roles is a multiselect action.
Bulk actions to clone albums across roles.</p>
<p>10) Follows &amp; Favorites (Boards)</p>
<p>Follow (global, simple):</p>
<p>Follow the user account (not per role) to keep counts meaningful.</p>
<p>Feed preferences let a follower choose which roletagged posts they
want to see (All / Model / Photographer / …).</p>
<p>Favorites (“Boards”):</p>
<p>Save either the role card (“Jane — Model”) or the user (“Jane — All
Roles”).</p>
<p>Boards can mix items but default to roleconsistent when saved from a
role search.</p>
<p>Create projectspecific boards (e.g., “Q2 Lookbook Models”) with
notes, tags, and share/collab options (optional future).</p>
<p>Quick actions on cards: Compare, Bulk message, Request availability
(future).</p>
<p>11) Posts &amp; Feeds (RoleTagged, Unified View)</p>
<p>Users can post updates (text, image, video). Each post must be tagged
with one or more roles.</p>
<p>Profile Posts tab defaults to the role being viewed; toggle to “All
roles”.</p>
<p>Global follower feed shows posts from accounts you follow; filter by
role tags.</p>
<p>Post types (examples): Portfolio release, BTS, Availability,
Lookingtocollab (but avoid “job board” styling), Deliverables
showcase.</p>
<p>12) Verification Badges &amp; DM Credits (Incentives)</p>
<p>Badge tiers:</p>
<p>Email verified</p>
<p>Phone/SMS verified (+5 newconversation message credits/month)</p>
<p>ID verified (+10 credits, search boost)</p>
<p>Background checked (“Trusted Pro”) (+∞ credits for new conversations,
top search tier)</p>
<p>Display: badges in header &amp; on search cards.</p>
<p>Search boost rules: Verified profiles rank above unverified (within
relevance range). Backgroundchecked get an extra boost.</p>
<p>Rationale: Tangible perks make verification desirable beyond trust
(more DMs, higher visibility), aligning with your incentive idea.</p>
<p>13) Admin &amp; Safety Controls (RoleAware)</p>
<p>Role completeness gates: a Service Profile must meet a minimal
completeness score (mandatory fields + 6+ portfolio items) to appear in
search.</p>
<p>Moderation by role: media, posts, and reviews are flagged in context
of a role.</p>
<p>Dispute/Report always tied to a booking (and thus to a role), keeping
records clean.</p>
<p>14) Analytics (User &amp; Internal)</p>
<p>For users (per role and overall):</p>
<p>Views, saves to boards, messages started, booking requests,
conversion rate, avg. response time.</p>
<p>Content performance: portfolio item views, post engagement.</p>
<p>For ops (internal):</p>
<p>Liquidity by city/role, search→inquiry→booking funnel, verification
adoption, dispute rates by role.</p>
<p>15) Edge Cases &amp; UX Rules</p>
<p>Multirole appearing in one search: Show only the matching role card;
breadcrumb says “Also offers: X” (link to other SP page).</p>
<p>Switching roles on profile: Keep sticky tabs visible; switching tabs
changes CTA &amp; fields seamlessly.</p>
<p>Adding a new role later: Onboarding wizard for that role (fields +
minimal portfolio) before activation.</p>
<p>Calendar conflicts: Booking on any role blocks the account calendar.
Attempting overlapping requests prompts a conflict resolution UI.</p>
<p>Reviews spillover: Do not mix ratings across roles in search ranking.
Display crossrole ratings in the header for transparency only.</p>
<p>16) MVP vs. PhaseUp (for scope control)</p>
<p>MVP must haves:</p>
<p>Linked Service Profiles; rolefirst search; rolespecific fields &amp;
portfolios; roleanchored bookings; rolespecific reviews; unified inbox
with role tags; basic follows; basic favorites boards; verification +
incentives (email/phone/ID); availability blocking; NSFW gating switch
(policy-dependent).</p>
<p>Phase 2+ enhancements:</p>
<p>Packages catalogs, advanced board collaboration, post analytics,
social metrics verification integrations, audience demographics for
creators, compare view for boards, saved search alerts, deep calendar
sync, and DND windows.</p>
<p>17) Acceptance Criteria (we can check these off)</p>
<p>From a Model search, multirole users appear only as Model cards with
rolespecific fields.</p>
<p>On reaching a profile from search, the Model tab is active; switching
tabs shows other roles without leaving the page.</p>
<p>Booking, messaging, and reviews are tied to the active role.</p>
<p>The inbox groups threads with role context and shows read
receipts.</p>
<p>Users can post once and tag the role(s); feeds and profile posts
filter accordingly.</p>
<p>Favorites boards accept both role cards and full users; boards are
organizable and shareable.</p>
<p>Verification badges grant DM credits and search boost; credits are
visible in a simple meter.</p>
<p>Calendar is global; bookings on any role block time across all
roles.</p>
<p>Design Rationale (short)</p>
<p>Rolescoped everything (search, rates, reviews, portfolio) = zero
confusion for buyers.</p>
<p>One account, linked Service Profiles = low maintenance for multirole
users (shared assets, one inbox).</p>
<p>Incentivized verification = safer community + tangible growth
perks.</p>
<p>Categoryfirst search = faster decisionmaking + cleaner filters.</p>
<p>Boards &amp; posts = stickiness, collaboration, and social proof
without turning into a job board.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.1 — Roles &amp; IA</p>
<p>FanSubscription Creator (OnlyFans/Fansly/etc.) — Role Definition</p>
<p>New role (toplevel): FanSubscription Creator (icon + label). Appears
alongside Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator in nav and
onboarding.</p>
<p>Age gate &amp; safe mode: The global “18+ results” toggle defaults
OFF for guests/new users. Turning it ON (with age confirmation) reveals
FanSubscription Creators and any profiles with Nudity Tier &gt;
Lingerie.</p>
<p>Portfolio policy: Onplatform nonexplicit content only (artistic
nudity allowed per policy). Explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited.
Links to paid fan platforms are allowed in a dedicated “Links”
block.</p>
<p>Deliverables scope: We support SFW collaborations and promo
deliverables (IG/TT/YT/X). We do not facilitate explicit content
production or sale.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria</p>
<p>“FanSubscription Creator” is its own role in the role picker, navbar,
and category landing pages.</p>
<p>Global 18+ toggle (default OFF) gates visibility; explanatory tooltip
clarifies policy.</p>
<p>Profile “Links” block exists; portfolio upload filters block explicit
content.</p>
<p>Addendum — §1.1 Roles &amp; Entity Model (Studios as Space Listings)
— FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Introduce Studios as space listings (not roles) that complement
talent bookings without diluting the core multirole account model. Keep
terminology crisp so search, profiles, reviews, and booking policies
remain coherent.</p>
<p>A) Entities &amp; Terminology (strictly §1.1 scope)</p>
<p>Account — one login that can own multiple assets.</p>
<p>Service Profile (Role) — a person-based offering the account can
operate under:<br />
Model • Photographer • Videographer • Creator • FanSubscription Creator
(unchanged).</p>
<p>Space Listing (Listing Type) — a place-based offering the account can
own: Studio.</p>
<p>When verified via the light process in §3.4, it displays the Verified
Studio badge.</p>
<p>Key distinction: Studios are listings, not roles. Service Profiles
represent people; Studio represents a rentable space.</p>
<p>B) Relationships (what can link to what)</p>
<p>An Account may own 0..N Service Profiles and 0..N Studio
listings.</p>
<p>Linking (optional): A Service Profile may link one of the Account’s
Studio listings (e.g., a photographer links their cyclorama).</p>
<p>Result: the Service Profile shows a “Owns/Has Studio” chip; the
linked Studio’s detail page shows “Hosted by {Profile}”.</p>
<p>Independence: Studios can exist without any Service Profile (e.g.,
host who only rents space).</p>
<p>C) Classification &amp; Surfaces</p>
<p>Public categories (highlevel):</p>
<p>People (roles): Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator /
FanSubscription Creator</p>
<p>Places (listings): Studio</p>
<p>Search role selector (later detailed in §4.1/§1.2) includes Studio
alongside People roles.</p>
<p>Profiles vs Listings:</p>
<p>Service Profile page = person’s offering + booking widget.</p>
<p>Studio Listing page = space details + hourly booking widget.<br />
(UX/page map specifics belong to §4.0/§4.1; this addendum only defines
the entities.)</p>
<p>D) Reviews, Reputation &amp; Policies (alignment only)</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; scores are typescoped:</p>
<p>Service Profiles accrue rolespecific reviews.</p>
<p>Studios accrue spacespecific reviews.</p>
<p>Reputation Score is computed separately for Service Profiles vs
Studios (consumed by ranking later).</p>
<p>Policies: Talent bookings follow talent matrices; Studio bookings
follow studio matrices (per §3.9/Studio addendum). (This addendum only
records that they are distinct.)</p>
<p>E) Verification &amp; Gating (entitylevel)</p>
<p>Service Profiles: ID → Instant Book; Background → Trusted Pro
(unchanged).</p>
<p>Studios: Studio Lite verification (address/doc check) → Verified
Studio badge; Instant Book may require verification (policy in
§3.4).</p>
<p>Safe Mode: applies to people profiles with 18+ settings; Studios are
not gated by Safe Mode.</p>
<p>F) Data Model (nontechnical description)</p>
<p>ServiceProfile: role_type, role_fields (varies by role),
verification_status (ID, BG), reputation metrics.</p>
<p>StudioListing: listing_type=studio, studio_fields (address
neighborhood, capacity, amenities), verification_status (unverified |
lite_verified), reputation metrics.</p>
<p>Link: optional association from ServiceProfile → StudioListing for
“owns/has studio” chip.</p>
<p>Booking: distinct booking objects for Service vs Studio; can be
Linked at checkout (see §1.3/§4.0 later).</p>
<p>G) Acceptance Criteria (to mark §1.1 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>Studios defined as Space Listings, distinct from Service Profiles
(roles).</p>
<p>Account may own multiple Service Profiles and Studio listings.</p>
<p>Linking from a Service Profile to an owned Studio is supported (for
crosssurfacing chips only; no coupling of reviews).</p>
<p>Review/Rep separation: Service reviews remain rolescoped; Studio
reviews are spacescoped.</p>
<p>Verification: Studio uses Studio Lite → Verified Studio badge;
Service verification unchanged.</p>
<p>Policy separation acknowledged: talent vs studio matrices handled in
their own sections.</p>
<p>H) Why this works</p>
<p>Clarity: People (roles) vs Places (studios) eliminates ambiguity in
search, reviews, and policies.</p>
<p>Scalability: One account can grow horizontally (new roles) and
vertically (add studio listings) without schema contortions.</p>
<p>Low coupling: Linking is optional and displayonly, preserving clean
ownership and independent</p>
<p>SubSection 1.2 — RoleSpecific Data &amp; Advanced Search</p>
<p>1) Design Goal</p>
<p>Make search pinpoint and commercially relevant (not gear-nerdy), so a
buyer can quickly find the exact look, reach, budget fit, availability,
and reliability they need—then book in a few clicks.</p>
<p>2) Global Search UX (CategoryFirst)</p>
<p>Step 1 (Required): User selects a Role to search: Models /
Photographers / Videographers / Creators.</p>
<p>Step 2: Search bar accepts keywords; Advanced Filters change per
role.</p>
<p>Result Card = Service Profile (rolescoped): name, city, role label,
role rating, starting rate, 2–3 rolespecific highlights, verification
badges, followers/engagement (if connected), and Instant Book badge (if
enabled).</p>
<p>Clickthrough: Goes to the role page (e.g., /u/jane/model) with sticky
tabs to view Jane’s other roles.</p>
<p>3) Global Filters (apply to every role)</p>
<p>Location &amp; distance radius</p>
<p>Available on (date/time picker) → “Only show profiles available on
this date”</p>
<p>Budget / starting rate (range)</p>
<p>Rating (min stars) &amp; # of reviews (min)</p>
<p>Verification (ID / Backgroundchecked / Socialverified)</p>
<p>Response time (e.g., “usually replies within 2h”)</p>
<p>Completion / cancellation rate (reliability)</p>
<p>Instant Book toggle (see §7)</p>
<p>Languages; Travel willing (local only / regional / national)</p>
<p>Last active (e.g., last 7 days)</p>
<p>These are the “what buyers care about” filters—availability, price,
quality, trust, reliability, and speed.</p>
<p>4) RoleSpecific Filters (what truly matters)</p>
<p>4.1 Models</p>
<p>Look &amp; presence (high impact):</p>
<p>Height, measurements (bust/chest, waist, hips; cup optional),
dress/clothing, shoe</p>
<p>Body type, tattoos, piercings, hair (color/length), eye color, skin
tone, facial hair (if applicable)</p>
<p>Age (18+ only platform), ethnicity (selfdescribed)</p>
<p>Categories/levels (fashion, beauty, fitness, swim, lingerie, artistic
nude if allowed—see §9)</p>
<p>Commercial/operational:</p>
<p>Rate (hour/day), travel radius &amp; travel fee, chaperone friendly,
release preference (e.g., standard model release)</p>
<p>Reliability signals: noshow rate, ontime rate, average reply time</p>
<p>Social signals (if connected): platform(s), followers range,
engagement rate, audience top geos, growth rate 30d (see §5)</p>
<p>Competitors already filter basics like hair/height/measurements; we
add reliability, availability, and audience quality—which they lack.</p>
<p>4.2 Photographers</p>
<p>Focus on result buyers see, not gear:</p>
<p>Specialties (portrait, fashion/editorial, beauty, commercial,
product, events)</p>
<p>Style descriptors (natural light, moody, highkey, cinematic,
colortrue, retouchedlook)</p>
<p>Deliverables (e.g., “# edited images”, RAW available?, lookbook,
campaign, ecomm sets)</p>
<p>Turnaround (e.g., 48h, 1 week)</p>
<p>Studio access (yes/no), preferred shoot types (instudio, outdoor),
chaperone welcome</p>
<p>Rate (hour/day/packages)</p>
<p>Reliability (completion rate, ontime rate), rating</p>
<p>Social signals (if connected): followers, engagement, recent
growth</p>
<p>We remove gear/software filters; nonphotographer buyers don’t care.
We foreground style, deliverables, turnaround, studio access, price,
reliability.</p>
<p>4.3 Videographers</p>
<p>Content types (shortform reels, promo, music video, event, interview,
product)</p>
<p>Deliverables (duration formats, aspect—vertical/horizontal), # of
revisions, sound capture (yes/no), captions (yes/no)</p>
<p>Turnaround, rate, travel</p>
<p>Style (snappy/reels, cinematic, docu, productclean)</p>
<p>Reliability, rating</p>
<p>Social signals (followers, avg views—if connected)</p>
<p>4.4 Content Creators / Influencers</p>
<p>Platforms (IG/TikTok/YouTube/…); posting frequency</p>
<p>Followers range, engagement rate, avg video views, story views (if
available)</p>
<p>Audience demographics (top countries/cities, age/gender splits) &amp;
brand safety tag</p>
<p>Niches (beauty, fitness, cosplay, gaming, fashion, etc.)</p>
<p>Deliverables &amp; rates (grid post, story set, reel/short, live,
bundle), lead time</p>
<p>Growth rate 30/90d, prior brand collabs</p>
<p>Reliability (ontime posting rate), rating</p>
<p>Verified social metrics &amp; audience demographics are available via
firstparty APIs when the creator connects their accounts (details §5).
TikTok Creator Marketplace &amp; IG Graph API support verified metrics
for optedin professional accounts; YouTube API provides channel
stats.</p>
<p>5) Social Metrics: Live, Verified &amp; Searchable</p>
<p>What’s possible (2025):</p>
<p>Instagram (Graph API): For Creator/Business accounts that connect, we
can fetch followers_count, media stats, and some insights; Business
Discovery lets you query other professional accounts’ public metrics
within policy. (Regular personal accounts are limited.)</p>
<p>YouTube Data/Analytics APIs: Provide subscriber counts, view counts,
watch time &amp; more for connected channels.</p>
<p>TikTok: Via Login/Display API we can show connected profile/video
info; richer audience/engagement demographics are available through
Creator Marketplace / Business integrations for optedin
creators/partners.</p>
<p>OnlyFans: No official public API; thirdparty wrappers rely on
reverseengineering and are not official or guaranteed. So we should not
promise live OF metrics; we can let creators link OF and selfdisclose
stats, optionally verified manually.</p>
<p>Product approach:</p>
<p>“Connect Socials” module for any role. If connected, we show a
Verified Social badge + live counts on profile &amp; enable search
filters (followers/engagement/growth/audience geos) for those users.</p>
<p>Privacy &amp; consent: Only metrics the user consents to share are
displayed and indexed.</p>
<p>Fallback when not connected: userentered stats (clearly marked
Unverified; not searchable by metrics).</p>
<p>Data freshness: sync nightly; fast ondemand refresh button with
ratelimits.</p>
<p>6) Packages &amp; Extras (Fiverrstyle) — Required on every Service
Profile</p>
<p>Each role supports:</p>
<p>Packages (Basic / Standard / Premium) with deliverables, turnaround,
revision count, and price.</p>
<p>Extras (addons): examples by role</p>
<p>Models: “Wardrobe change packs”, “Travel to location (miles)”,
“Social shoutout addon”, “Rush booking”</p>
<p>Photographers: “Extra edited images”, “Rush delivery”, “RAWs”,
“Studio included”, “MUA coordination”</p>
<p>Videographers: “Extra revisions”, “Captions/subtitles”, “Vertical
cutdowns”, “Thumbnail package”</p>
<p>Creators: “Extra story frames”, “Link in bio (X days)”, “Pin post (X
days)”, “Crosspost to TikTok”</p>
<p>Usage/licensing tiers (Commercial / Paid Ads / Exclusive / Buyout)
with clear pricing.</p>
<p>Instant Book allowed when provider sets autorules (e.g., package X,
availability, radius).</p>
<p>This removes TFP ambiguity and makes booking pure ecommerce: see
options → add extras → pay → schedule.</p>
<p>7) Fixing the “Manual Networking” Problem (for low and highfollower
users)</p>
<p>A. Instant Book + Smart Availability</p>
<p>Talent can optin to Instant Book by defining guardrails (packages,
calendar windows, location radius). Search filter “Instant Book” shows
readytobook now talent.</p>
<p>Smart availability filter: pick date/time → show only available
Service Profiles.</p>
<p>B. Smart Invites (private, not a job board)</p>
<p>A buyer can select up to N profiles and send a single, personalized
booking invite that reaches each privately (no public listing).</p>
<p>Autoaccept rules (for busy/highfollower talent): “autoaccept if:
package ≥ $X, travel ≤ Y, brand safe, date in my windows.”</p>
<p>C. Concierge (Pro)</p>
<p>For VIPs and brands: a paid Concierge that assembles shortlists,
handles invites, negotiates packages/extras, and schedules. Revenue:
subscription or perengagement fee.</p>
<p>D. Collab Mode (for highhigh, noncash)</p>
<p>Zerocash collaboration contracts with deliverables (shoot +
crossposting obligations). Both sides sign; platform tracks performance
(proofofpost, content delivered).</p>
<p>We monetize via Pro plan features, not commission, and still accrue
reviews + reliability metrics.</p>
<p>E. AudienceFit Match</p>
<p>For creators/models: filter/score by audience geos and engagement
(e.g., “US female 18–24 heavy”) so buyers pay for reach that
matters.</p>
<p>Existing platforms make you post castings or DM endlessly; Swipecast
leans into job posts with live chat. We avoid public job boards and keep
1to1 booking, plus powerful smart invites and autoaccept to remove the
manual grind.</p>
<p>8) Boards (Favorites) for Real Projects</p>
<p>Save role cards into project boards, add notes (budget, fit,
priority).</p>
<p>Bulk actions: Invite all, Request availability, Compare (rates,
social reach, reliability).</p>
<p>Share board as private link to collaborators (internal/agency
use).</p>
<p>9) NSFW &amp; OnlyFans Policy — Decision Framework &amp;
Recommendation</p>
<p>Reality: payment processors (Stripe/PayPal) restrict adult content;
explicit sexual content risks account shutdowns.</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p>Mainstreamfirst (Recommended)</p>
<p>Allow SFW + artistic nudity (nonexplicit) with NSFW gating and age/ID
verification; disallow explicit sexual content onplatform.</p>
<p>Allow OnlyFans creators as users; portfolios must follow our content
rules. They can link to OF externally; we don’t ingest OF metrics (no
official API).</p>
<p>Use mainstream processors (easier scaling &amp; brandsafe).</p>
<p>Adultfriendly lane (complex)</p>
<p>Permit explicit content in a segregated, agegated area; requires
adultfriendly payment processors and heavy compliance (age checks,
recordkeeping). High ops/compliance cost; potential ad restrictions.</p>
<p>Recommendation: Option 1 for launch. Capture the boudoir/glamour
business and OF creators (as creators) without explicit content on the
site. Revisit a dedicated adult lane only after strong traction and
compliance capability.</p>
<p>10) SingleCompose Feed (No Double Posting), Smart Delivery</p>
<p>User posts once, tags one or more roles (Model/Photog/etc.).</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>Followers choose role preferences when following a user; the feed
shows posts matching their interests first.</p>
<p>Dedupe: if a post is multitagged, we only show it once to the
follower.</p>
<p>Profile Posts tab defaults to the role you’re viewing; toggle “All
roles”.</p>
<p>Templates: Availability update, Portfolio drop, BTS, Looking to
collab (private invite CTA, not public job).</p>
<p>Optional: crosspost to connected socials (later).</p>
<p>This keeps posting simple for multirole users while giving followers
clean, relevant feeds.</p>
<p>11) Extra Verifications (low cost, high trust)</p>
<p>Baseline (free): email + phone/SMS; 2FA optional.</p>
<p>ID &amp; Age (paid): document + selfie liveness via IDV provider
(e.g., Persona/Onfido). Typical SMB pricing starts around $250/mo
platform minimums or percheck fees; we can pass costs to users wanting
the badge.</p>
<p>Background Check (paid, optional “Trusted Pro”): US checks via vendor
(e.g., Checkr packages ~$30–$90/report). We pass through + small margin;
renewal annually.</p>
<p>SocialVerified (free): connect IG/TikTok/YT for verified metrics
badge (see §5).</p>
<p>PaymentVerified (free): valid card/bank on file.</p>
<p>StudioVerified (optional): onetime address + utility/biz doc for
studio listings.</p>
<p>ReferenceVerified (free): after N completed bookings with &gt;4★
average, earn “Great Partner” ribbon (automated).</p>
<p>Incentives: Each badge improves search boost and DM credits (as we
set in §1.1), so verification increases bookings and offsets its
cost.</p>
<p>12) Pricing Impact of Verifications</p>
<p>We do not absorb expensive checks at scale; instead:</p>
<p>Passthrough direct costs (IDV/background) with small margin.</p>
<p>Bundle into Pro subscription (includes 1 ID check + search boost +
analytics Pro).</p>
<p>Net effect: verifications pay for themselves via higher ranking, more
DMs, Instant Book eligibility, and higher conversion. (We’ll track
uplift in Analytics, §13.)</p>
<p>13) ProviderSide Analytics (RightSized)</p>
<p>Core (free)</p>
<p>Views → Messages → Bookings funnel (per role)</p>
<p>Search queries &amp; top filters that surfaced you (e.g., “5′8″+
fitness models in Houston”)</p>
<p>Avg position in search for your key filters (est.)</p>
<p>Package performance (acceptance, upsell to extras)</p>
<p>Reliability metrics (response time, cancellation rate)</p>
<p>Social snippet if connected: followers, engagement trend (30d)</p>
<p>Pro (paid)</p>
<p>Audience analytics (for creators): geo/age/gender summaries from
APIs</p>
<p>Benchmarking: your rates/turnaround vs. local peers (by role &amp;
rating)</p>
<p>Price optimizer suggestions (raise/drop by X% based on
conversion)</p>
<p>Boarding intelligence: who saved you to boards; abandoned invite
recovery prompts</p>
<p>ROI calculators (e.g., cost per 1k engaged audience for
creators/models)</p>
<p>We’ll use public platform benchmarks to contextualize engagement
expectations (e.g., TikTok engagement averages).</p>
<p>14) Acceptance Criteria (for this section)</p>
<p>Rolefirst search with rolespecific filters deployed.</p>
<p>SocialVerified users show live metrics and can be filtered by
followers/engagement/audience (platform permitting).</p>
<p>Packages + Extras required for checkout across roles.</p>
<p>Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept rules working (nonpublic,
not a job board).</p>
<p>NSFW policy implemented per recommendation (artistic nudity only;
explicit disallowed; NSFW gating + 18+ checks).</p>
<p>Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and
dedupe.</p>
<p>Verification badges confer search boost + DM credits; paid checks
passthrough costs.</p>
<p>Core Analytics panel live; Pro Analytics gated behind
subscription.</p>
<p>15) Competitive Notes (Why this wins)</p>
<p>ModelMayhem/PurplePort: filters exist for appearance but lack
availability, reliability, and true audience metrics; UX is dated and
often forum/casting dependent. We modernize with ecommerce booking,
reputation signals, and socialverified discovery.</p>
<p>Swipecast: strong on job posts &amp; payments, but our smart invites
+ instant book + verified social metrics deliver faster 1to1 bookings
and eliminate the “manual casting call” drag.</p>
<p>Quick Answers to Your Specific Points</p>
<p>“Live display of social metrics &amp; searchable?” Yes, for connected
Instagram Creator/Business, YouTube, and TikTok (within respective
APIs/permissions). OF has no official public API—so no live OF
search.</p>
<p>“Don’t show gear/software for photographers.” Done—our filters focus
on style, deliverables, turnaround, rate, reliability, studio
access.</p>
<p>“No TFP in search; make it like Airbnb/Fiverr.” Agreed—Packages +
Extras with instant book/escrow = frictionless paid bookings. We support
Collab Mode separately for highhigh noncash pairings (keeps brand clean
&amp; still builds reputation).</p>
<p>“NSFW &amp; OnlyFans?” Launch mainstreamfirst (allow artistic nudity
with gating, no explicit content). Allow OF creators on the platform but
don’t ingest OF metrics. This keeps payments simple
(Stripe/PayPalcompatible) and brandsafe.</p>
<p>“One post or multiple per role?” One post with role tags; followers
see only what they opted into; profile posts default to the active role
tab.</p>
<p>“More verifications?” Added SocialVerified, PaymentVerified,
StudioVerified, ReferenceVerified—lowcost, hightrust. Paid checks (ID,
Background) are passthrough with perks to offset cost.</p>
<p>“Analytics size?” Start with Core (funnel, search terms, package
performance), then upsell Pro (benchmarks, audience analytics, price
optimizer).</p>
<p>A) Global search flow (unchanged)</p>
<p>Step 1 (required): pick a role to search (Models / Photographers /
Videographers / Creators).</p>
<p>Step 2: rolespecific filters appear; result card is a Service Profile
(SP) with role label, rating, starting price, highlights, verification,
social metrics (if verified), and Instant Book badge (if enabled).</p>
<p>B) Rolespecific filters (final list)</p>
<p>Global filters (all roles): Location+radius, Available on
(date/time), Budget (range), Rating &amp; # reviews, Verification (ID /
Background / SocialVerified), Response time, Completion rate, Instant
Book, Languages, Travel willing, Last active.</p>
<p>Models — “find the look + reliability + reach”</p>
<p>Look: height; measurements (bust/chest, waist, hips; cup optin);
dress/clothing; shoe; body type; tattoos; piercings; hair
(color/length); eye color; skin tone; facial hair (if applicable); age
(18+ only); ethnicity (selfdescribed).</p>
<p>Work &amp; logistics: categories (fashion, beauty, fitness, swim,
artistic nude); base rate (hour/day); travel radius/fee;
chaperonefriendly; release preference.</p>
<p>Reliability: reply time, ontime rate, noshow rate.</p>
<p>Social (if connected): platform(s), followers range, engagement rate,
30day growth, audience geos.</p>
<p>Photographers — “style, output, speed, price”</p>
<p>Style/specialty: portrait, fashion/editorial, beauty, commercial,
product, events; style descriptors (natural light, cinematic, highkey,
moody, colortrue).</p>
<p>Deliverables: edited image count, RAW provided?, lookbook/ecomm sets;
turnaround; studio access (yes/no); preferred shoot type
(studio/outdoor).</p>
<p>Rates: hour/day, packages.</p>
<p>Reliability: completion, ontime, rating.</p>
<p>Social (if connected): followers, engagement, recent growth.</p>
<p>Videographers — “format, deliverables, speed, price”</p>
<p>Types: reels/shorts, promo, music video, event, interview,
product.</p>
<p>Deliverables: runtime(s), aspect (vertical/horizontal), revisions,
sound capture, captions.</p>
<p>Turnaround, rate, travel.</p>
<p>Style: snappy/reels, cinematic, docu, productclean.</p>
<p>Reliability &amp; social (as above).</p>
<p>Creators/Influencers — “reach that matches goals”</p>
<p>Platforms: IG/TikTok/YouTube (multiselect).</p>
<p>Followers, engagement rate, avg views, story views (if
available).</p>
<p>Audience: top countries/cities; age/gender split (if available).</p>
<p>Niches: beauty, fitness, cosplay, gaming, fashion, etc.</p>
<p>Deliverables &amp; rates: grid post, stories pack, reel/short, live,
bundles; lead time.</p>
<p>Growth (30/90d); prior brand collabs; reliability (ontime posting
rate), rating.</p>
<p>Note: these social filters are enabled when a user has granted the
platform access via Instagram Graph / YouTube / TikTok APIs; otherwise
results can include Unverified stats only if the buyer toggles them
on.</p>
<p>C) Packages &amp; extras (final)</p>
<p>Booking baseline (required): Every SP must have either</p>
<p>≥1 package (Basic/Standard/Premium with deliverables, turnaround,
revisions), or</p>
<p>A clear hourly/day rate (min duration + what’s included).</p>
<p>Extras (optional but encouraged):</p>
<p>Models: wardrobe changes; travel miles; social shoutout; rush
booking.</p>
<p>Photographers: extra edits; rush delivery; RAWs; studio included; MUA
coordination.</p>
<p>Videographers: extra revisions; captions; vertical cutdowns;
thumbnails.</p>
<p>Creators: extra stories; linkinbio days; pinnedpost days; crosspost
to TikTok.</p>
<p>Usage/licensing tiers for all roles (Commercial / Ads / Exclusive /
Buyout) with transparent pricing.</p>
<p>D) Instant Book / Smart Invites / Autoaccept (final)</p>
<p>Instant Book (optin):</p>
<p>Talent defines rules: which packages, price minimum, travel radius,
date windows, advancenotice buffer.</p>
<p>If the buyer’s request matches, they can book instantly (escrow
charged; calendar autoblocked; chat opens for details).</p>
<p>Talent can cap daily/weekly instant bookings to avoid overload.</p>
<p>Smart Invites (private, not a job board):</p>
<p>A buyer selects up to N profiles and sends a single invite (shared
brief, proposed date/time/package, budget).</p>
<p>Each recipient receives a private request; the buyer can award 1 slot
(first to accept or manual choose) or multiple slots for team
shoots.</p>
<p>Prevents broadcast spam; keeps everything 1to1.</p>
<p>Autoaccept (for highdemand users):</p>
<p>Talent can set autoaccept rules (e.g., “autoaccept Standard or
Premium packages ≥ $X, weekday 10am–2pm, within 10 miles”).</p>
<p>Perfect for highfollower users who don’t want backandforth.</p>
<p>Payment is captured on accept; cancellation rules apply.</p>
<p>These three together eliminate the “manual chase” for both
lowfollower buyers (instant transactions) and highfollowertohighfollower
pairings (autoaccept + Smart Invites).</p>
<p>E) Social metrics (productized)</p>
<p>Connect Socials (any role):</p>
<p>Instagram (Creator/Business): followers_count, recent media stats,
and Insights where permissioned.</p>
<p>YouTube: subscriberCount, views, watch time via Data/Analytics
APIs.</p>
<p>TikTok: Display/authorized user info (follower counts where scopes
permit).</p>
<p>OnlyFans: link only (no live metrics—no official public API).</p>
<p>Verification levels:</p>
<p>Verified Social (connected): metrics shown, appear in Verifiedonly
filters.</p>
<p>Unverified (selfreported): labeled clearly; excluded when buyers
toggle “Verified only.”</p>
<p>How we compute “engagement rate”:</p>
<p>IG: avg(likes+comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.</p>
<p>TikTok: avg views/likes on last 20 public videos ÷ followers (show
both ER and avg views).</p>
<p>YouTube: avg views per video last 20 ÷ subscribers (plus shorts vs
nonshorts disclosure).<br />
(Exact formulas displayed in “ⓘ” tooltips on the filter panel.)</p>
<p>Freshness &amp; load:</p>
<p>Nightly sync; manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform
(ratelimited).</p>
<p>We store daily snapshots to calculate 30/90day growth and show a
trend sparkline.</p>
<p>Privacy: users choose which platforms to show and which metrics to
index in search.</p>
<p>F) NSFW &amp; OnlyFans (launch rules)</p>
<p>Allowed: SFW and artistic nudity (nonexplicit), behind an NSFW
toggle; 18+ verified users only.</p>
<p>Disallowed: explicit sexual content, pornographic acts,
escorting/services.</p>
<p>OF creators welcome: can link OF; onsite portfolio must follow our
rules; no live OF metrics.</p>
<p>Why: Stripe/PayPal restrictions on adult content; this path preserves
mainstream payments and brandsafe growth.</p>
<p>G) Feed (singlecompose, multitag)</p>
<p>Creators post once and tag one or more roles.</p>
<p>Follower preferences: when following, users choose which role tags
they want to see; feed shows relevant posts once (deduped).</p>
<p>On profile, Posts defaults to the active role tab; toggle “All
roles.”</p>
<p>H) Acceptance criteria (updated)</p>
<p>Rolefirst search with final role filters above.</p>
<p>Verifiedonly social filters work for IG/YouTube/TikTok when
connected; Unverified stats clearly labeled and excluded by default.</p>
<p>Every SP has ≥1 package or a base rate; extras optional.</p>
<p>Instant Book, Smart Invites, and Autoaccept function as
specified.</p>
<p>NSFW policy enforced (artistic nudity gated; explicit disallowed); OF
linking allowed.</p>
<p>Singlecompose, multitag feed with follower role preferences and
dedupe.</p>
<p>Implementation notes (brief)</p>
<p>Search index: Each Service Profile is its own document; social
metrics fields are written only for Verified Social accounts (with a
usertoggle to include/exclude unverified numbers in search results).</p>
<p>Metrics storage: Perplatform table of daily snapshots → compute
30/90day growth and ER.</p>
<p>UI copy: On filters, add “ⓘ Verified by platform connection”; on
unverified, “ⓘ Selfreported (not platform verified)”.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.2 (Search)</p>
<p>RoleSpecific Data &amp; Advanced Search</p>
<p>Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing
role filters (e.g., §1.2.7 → §1.2.11). Keep all trust/verification
definitions in §1.5; only keep here what directly affects search UI,
filters, results, and ranking.</p>
<p>§1.2.7 PerPlatform Social Search (IG, YT, TT, X; Phase2: LinkedIn,
Facebook Pages, Snapchat)</p>
<p>New filter group: “Social Platforms.” Users toggle any mix of
platforms, then set perplatform filters:</p>
<p>Instagram — Followers (min–max), Engagement Rate (min %), 30/90day
growth (min %).<br />
Live when the user connects an IG Business/Creator account; Business
Discovery may show limited public metrics for other pro accounts, within
policy.</p>
<p>YouTube — Subscribers (min–max), Avg views/video (min), 30/90day
growth.<br />
Live when channel is connected.</p>
<p>TikTok — Followers (min–max), Avg views/video (min), Engagement Rate
(min %), 30/90day growth.<br />
Live when account is connected (scopes required).</p>
<p>X (Twitter) — Followers (min–max), Engagement (avg
likes+reposts+replies), growth.<br />
Subject to API access level/quotas.</p>
<p>Phase2 (optin): LinkedIn Pages/Members, Facebook Pages, Snapchat
Public Profiles — Followers/subscribers if connected and API access
granted.<br />
Until then: linkonly + selfreported stats (clearly marked
Unverified).</p>
<p>Filter logic:</p>
<p>Match ANY (default) or Match ALL selected platforms.</p>
<p>Verifiedonly toggle (only include metrics pulled via official
connections/APIs).</p>
<p>Optional Include selfreported toggle to expand results.</p>
<p>Result cards: perplatform chips, e.g., IG 182k • 2.8% ER, TT 530k •
120k avg views, with a “ⓘ Verified by platform” tooltip.</p>
<p>§1.2.8 Engagement Metrics — Definitions &amp; BeginnerFriendly UX</p>
<p>Computed consistently (shown in tooltips):</p>
<p>IG ER = avg (likes + comments) on last 12 feed posts ÷ followers.</p>
<p>TikTok ER = avg (likes + comments + shares) on last 20 public videos
÷ followers; also show avg views.</p>
<p>YouTube = avg views on last 20 uploads (Shorts vs longform shown
separately) ÷ subscribers.</p>
<p>X = avg (likes + reposts + replies) on last 20 posts ÷ followers.</p>
<p>Controls:</p>
<p>Simple mode: “Engagement level” slider (Low ↔︎ High) with presets
(e.g., Top 20%, Top 10% in city/role).</p>
<p>Advanced mode: numeric inputs (ER ≥ %, Avg views ≥ N).</p>
<p>Inline explainer: “Followers ≠ engagement” (1sentence card with
example).</p>
<p>Freshness: nightly sync + manual refresh up to 3×/day per platform
(ratelimited).</p>
<p>§1.2.9 Supported Platforms — Day1 vs Phase2</p>
<p>Day1: Instagram (Business/Creator), YouTube, TikTok, X/Twitter
(connected accounts).</p>
<p>Phase2: LinkedIn Pages/Members (partner access), Facebook Pages,
Snapchat Public Profiles (partner access).</p>
<p>Always linkonly fallback: users can selfreport (labeled Unverified)
and request manual verify for large accounts.</p>
<p>§1.2.10 Search Integration with Trust Signals &amp; Boosting
(hooks)</p>
<p>(Definitions and policies live in §1.5; this subsection defines how
search uses them.)</p>
<p>Studio access (from §1.5): add Search filter: Studio access =
Verified.</p>
<p>References (from §1.5): add Search filter: Has verified references (≥
N).</p>
<p>Reputation Score (from §1.5):</p>
<p>Filter: Min Rep Score; Sort: Top Reputation.</p>
<p>Ranking: Rep Score is a tiebreaker after relevance, availability,
distance, price.</p>
<p>Paid Boosting (pricing &amp; rules detailed later in
Monetization):</p>
<p>Search can render Promoted placements (Search Boost, Profile
Highlight) only if the result still matches all active filters.</p>
<p>Enforce ad density caps (e.g., ≤2 promoted in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).</p>
<p>Eligibility checks (Rep ≥ 70, ID Verified, no recent strikes) come
from §1.5 signals.</p>
<p>§1.2.11 Acceptance Criteria (Search addendum)</p>
<p>Search supports perplatform filters (IG, YT, TT, X), Verifiedonly
toggle, and ANY/ALL logic; Phase2 placeholders for
LinkedIn/Facebook/Snapchat.</p>
<p>Result cards show perplatform chips with verified tooltips; profile
pages show chips + trend sparklines.</p>
<p>Engagement filters offer Simple (Top 10/20%) and Advanced (ER %, Avg
views) modes; tooltips explain each metric plainly.</p>
<p>Filters for trust signals (Studio Verified, Verified references, Min
Rep Score) are available and integrated into ranking as specified.</p>
<p>Promoted slots render with clear labeling, density caps, and only
within matching searches.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.2 — Search (Models/Creators) — Comfort &amp; Boundary
Filters + FanSubscription Creators (FINAL)</p>
<p>Policy anchor: We’re mainstreamfirst. Artistic nudity (nonexplicit)
is allowed; explicit sexual content/acts are not. All nudityrelated
options are 18+ and IDgated (see §3.4). Processors remain
mainstreamsafe.</p>
<p>A) Comfort &amp; Boundary Filters (visible on Model/Creator profiles
&amp; in search)</p>
<p>Nudity tier (multiselect, 18+ only):</p>
<p>No Nudity</p>
<p>Lingerie/Swimwear</p>
<p>Implied Nudity (no explicit exposure)</p>
<p>Topless (nonsexualized context; policycompliant)</p>
<p>Artistic Nude (nonexplicit; no sexual acts)</p>
<p>Content boundaries (toggle chips): sheer/seethrough, bodypaint,
boudoir, glamour, fetish (not allowed) clearly flagged as
disallowed.</p>
<p>Comfort notes: freetext “Do/Don’t” section (e.g., “comfortable with
implied shower scenes; no oil/latex”).</p>
<p>Chaperone policy: “Chaperone welcome” toggle; “Femaleonly teams
preferred” toggle.</p>
<p>Search panel gets these as filters; results show chips like “Artistic
Nude • Chaperone OK”.</p>
<p>B) FanSubscription Creators (e.g., OnlyFans/Fansly) — role &amp;
search support</p>
<p>Role mapping: treat as a Creator subtype: “FanSubscription
Creator”.</p>
<p>Portfolio rules: no explicit sexual content on our platform; link
outs allowed in a dedicated “Links” section.</p>
<p>Metrics: since there’s no reliable public API, show selfreported
subscriber counts with “Unverified” label; allow manual verification on
request (e.g., screenshot billing dashboard → staff verifies → “Verified
by Platform” chip).</p>
<p>Search filters: “FanSubscription Creator: Yes”, Subscriber count
(selfreported), Open to Collabs toggle.</p>
<p>Collab deliverables: add preset deliverables like IG Collab Post,
Story Mention, TT Duet/Stitch, with posting windows (e.g., within 72h)
and link verification (see §3.5 addendum below).</p>
<p>C) Age &amp; Policy Gates</p>
<p>IDverified 18+ required to select any nudity tier above
Lingerie/Swimwear.</p>
<p>Booking form includes Nudity &amp; Boundaries step; both parties
confirm tiers and chaperone policy.</p>
<p>Autoflagging: briefs requesting explicit sexual acts are blocked with
policy guidance.</p>
<p>D) Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>Search filters for Nudity Tier, Chaperone OK, Comfort notes present;
chips displayed on cards/profile.</p>
<p>Creator subtype “FanSubscription Creator” live; linkout section;
selfreported metrics with “Unverified” label + optional manual
verify.</p>
<p>Booking brief includes Nudity &amp; Boundaries acknowledgments; ID
gate enforced.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.2 — Search &amp; Discovery</p>
<p>Filters &amp; Chips for FanSubscription Creators</p>
<p>New filter group: Creator Type</p>
<p>FanSubscription Creator (toggle) — shows only creators who
selfidentify in this role.</p>
<p>Metrics (roleaware)</p>
<p>Subscriber count (selfreported) — ranges: 0–1k, 1–5k, 5–20k, 20–100k,
100k+ (shown with Unverified label unless manually verified).</p>
<p>Promo readiness — “Open to collabs,” “Open to SFW shoots,” preferred
platforms (IG/TT/YT/X).</p>
<p>Social metrics — perplatform followers/ER/growth (from OAuth
connections), as already defined in §1.2 addendum.</p>
<p>Comfort &amp; safety chips (present for this role too)</p>
<p>Nudity Tier (No Nudity, Lingerie/Swim, Implied, Topless, Artistic
Nude), Chaperone OK, Femaleonly teams preferred.</p>
<p>Results UI</p>
<p>Cards display role chip: “FanSubscription Creator”, plus social chips
(IG 182k • 3% ER) and, if supplied, Subs 5–20k (Unverified).</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria</p>
<p>New role filter &amp; result chips live; 18+ toggle must be ON to
surface these results.</p>
<p>Subscriber count is labeled Unverified by default; manual
verification adds a Verified by Platform chip.</p>
<p>Addendum — §1.2 Search &amp; Discovery (Studios) — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Add Studios as a searchable space listing type with
creativespecific filters, clear result cards, savedsearch support, and
ranking rules that keep talentfirst flows intact. This does not elevate
Studios to a coequal pillar—just a complementary search mode and attach
step.</p>
<p>A) Role Selector &amp; Entry Points</p>
<p>Role selector (top of Search) adds Studio alongside Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.</p>
<p>Safe Mode: does not hide Studios (no 18+ gating for spaces).</p>
<p>Attach in flow: When a buyer searches talent with a date/time, a
“Suggest Studios nearby” pill appears; clicking opens the Studio search
prefiltered by city/date/time.</p>
<p>B) Filters (Studio role only)</p>
<p>Core</p>
<p>City &amp; radius (mi/km)</p>
<p>Date &amp; time window (single slot or range)</p>
<p>Duration (hours) with Min hours enforcement</p>
<p>Price / hr (min–max)</p>
<p>Capacity (people)</p>
<p>Size (sq ft / m²) (optional)</p>
<p>Creative amenities (toggle chips)</p>
<p>Natural light (orientation optional: N/E/S/W)</p>
<p>Cyclorama wall (chip) + dimension field (optional)</p>
<p>Blackout capable</p>
<p>Ceiling height ≥ N ft</p>
<p>Soundtreated / quiet</p>
<p>Parking / loadin (street, lot, garage; freight elevator)</p>
<p>Makeup station / dressing room</p>
<p>Seamless paper available (colors count)</p>
<p>Grip/lighting available (Yes/No; rental addon)</p>
<p>Climate control (A/C)</p>
<p>Kitchenette / bathroom / shower</p>
<p>Set builds / backgrounds allowed</p>
<p>Rules &amp; policies</p>
<p>Instant Book only (toggle)</p>
<p>Verified Studio only (toggle)</p>
<p>Overtime policy shown (readonly pill in results)</p>
<p>Sort</p>
<p>Best match (default), Price, Distance, Availability first, Rating</p>
<p>C) Results UX</p>
<p>Card content</p>
<p>Cover image; Title; Neighborhood; Price / hr; Min hours</p>
<p>Verified Studio badge (if Liteverified)</p>
<p>Amenity chips (e.g., Natural light • Cyc wall • Blackout • 14’
ceilings)</p>
<p>Instant Book chip (if enabled)</p>
<p>Capacity; Rating (★, count)</p>
<p>Map view</p>
<p>Optional toggle; markers show price/hr; hover sync with list.</p>
<p>Empty states</p>
<p>If no matches: show nearby neighborhoods, relaxfilters tips, and
“Broaden date window” quick actions.</p>
<p>D) Saved Searches &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>Users can Save Search in Studio mode (all filters preserved).</p>
<p>Daily batched alerts for new/updated studios matching the saved
query.</p>
<p>Combo templates: “Talent + Studio in [City] this weekend” creates two
saved searches (talent &amp; studio) tied to the same date window.</p>
<p>E) Ranking Logic (Studio role)</p>
<p>Order = Relevance to filters → Availability match (slot fit, min
hours) → Distance → Price fit (to buyer’s range) → Reputation (space
reviews) → Verified Studio tiebreak → Instant Book tiebreak.</p>
<p>No paytowin: Paid promotions (if enabled later per §3.3) sit in
clearly labeled, densitycapped positions and never bypass filter
matching.</p>
<p>Freshness: recent calendar updates get a small boost (avoids stale
listings).</p>
<p>F) AttachinFlow (from Talent Search)</p>
<p>When a buyer has a talent query with a date/time:</p>
<p>A “Attach a Studio” pill appears above results.</p>
<p>Clicking opens the Studio search preseeded with
city/date/time/duration; top three results appear in an inline drawer
with amenity chips.</p>
<p>Selecting a studio adds it to the checkout summary as a Linked
Booking Group (see §1.3 addendum).</p>
<p>G) Analytics &amp; Events</p>
<p>search.role=studio, filter.apply.amenity,
studio.instant_book.filter_on</p>
<p>saved_search.create.studio, alert.open.studio</p>
<p>attach_studio.opened, attach_studio.suggested_click,
attach_studio.selected</p>
<p>H) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.2 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>Studio appears in role selector; Safe Mode does not gate Studio
visibility.</p>
<p>Studiospecific filters implemented (core, creative amenities,
rules).</p>
<p>Result cards show Verified badge, Instant Book chip, amenity chips,
capacity, rating.</p>
<p>Saved search &amp; daily alerts work in Studio mode; combo template
creates paired searches.</p>
<p>Attach a Studio pill appears in talent searches with date/time; opens
prefiltered Studio drawer; selection persists to checkout.</p>
<p>Ranking follows relevance → availability → distance → price fit → rep
→ verified → IB; no paytowin.</p>
<p>I) Why this works</p>
<p>Creators’ needs first: Filters reflect real shoot needs (light, cyc,
blackout, loadin).</p>
<p>Low friction attach: Suggesting studios in context boosts award rates
without bloating nav.</p>
<p>Clean ranking: Availability &amp; fit come before badges, keeping
search results trustworthy.</p>
<p>SubSection 1.3 — Booking, Payments &amp; Disputes</p>
<p>Purpose: Make booking as fast and trustable as Airbnb/Fiverr: clear
options, instant or nearinstant confirmation, escrowed payment,
transparent cancellation rules, and a fair dispute process — all
optimized for repeatable revenue and low support overhead.</p>
<p>A) Key Concepts &amp; Objects</p>
<p>Service Profile (SP): The bookable unit for a role (Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator). All bookings are tied to a
specific SP.</p>
<p>Package: A preconfigured offer (deliverables, duration, turnaround,
revisions, price). Each SP must have ≥1 package or a base hourly/day
rate.</p>
<p>Extras (optional): Addons the buyer can select at checkout (rush,
extra edits, travel miles, etc.). Not required to publish.</p>
<p>Usage License: A selectable tier (Commercial / Ads / Exclusive /
Buyout) with clear terms &amp; price adders.</p>
<p>Instant Book: Book without messaging if the request matches the SP’s
autorules.</p>
<p>Smart Invite: Private multirecipient invite (no public job board)
that lets the buyer send one request to N profiles and award 1 or more
slots.</p>
<p>Autoaccept Rules (optin): Talent-defined conditions that autoaccept
requests (e.g., package ≥ $X, weekday window, &lt;=10 miles).</p>
<p>B) Booking Modes (How a booking starts)</p>
<p>Instant Book (optin by talent)</p>
<p>Visible “Instant Book” badge in search.</p>
<p>Buyer selects date/time, package, extras, license, location, pays →
booking confirmed immediately if within rules.</p>
<p>Calendar blocked; chat thread opens automatically.</p>
<p>RequesttoBook</p>
<p>Buyer configures the same elements; sends a request.</p>
<p>Talent can Accept / Decline / Counter (send Custom Offer with
different package/price/time).</p>
<p>On Accept, payment is captured and booking confirmed.</p>
<p>SLA nudges: autoexpire unanswered requests (e.g., 48h) to keep the
funnel clean.</p>
<p>Smart Invite (private)</p>
<p>Buyer selects up to N profiles → writes one brief (date/time,
package/budget).</p>
<p>Each recipient receives a private invite; buyer can award one or
multiple hires.</p>
<p>Reduces backandforth while avoiding a public job board.</p>
<p>C) Checkout &amp; Payment Flow (Buyer experience)</p>
<p>Select Offer: Choose package or base rate duration; pick extras and
license tier.</p>
<p>Pick Date/Time: Required; availability filter helps show open
slots.</p>
<p>Location: Address or “studio provided by talent” if applicable;
travel fee dynamically calculated if the SP adds permile pricing.</p>
<p>Contract Pack (autoattached):</p>
<p>Booking Agreement (scope, deliverables, schedule, payment terms,
cancellation, safety rules).</p>
<p>Usage License (for photographer/videographer deliverables; simple,
prepriced tiers).</p>
<p>Model Release (autoattached if booking a model).</p>
<p>Content Promotion Terms (for Creators: posting timeline, tag/credit
rules).</p>
<p>Parties esign at checkout; all docs stored with the booking.</p>
<p>Summary &amp; Fees: Subtotal, platform fees (see §E), taxes (if any),
and escrow notice.</p>
<p>Pay &amp; Confirm: Card or bank method; funds moved to escrow;
confirmation screen and email. Calendar blocks for both parties; chat
opens.</p>
<p>Tip: Show a small “What you get” panel (deliverables, revisions,
turnaround, license) and a separate “What’s not included” to reduce
postshoot disputes.</p>
<p>D) Escrow, Release, and Payouts (Money movement)</p>
<p>Escrow on Accept/Book: Buyer is charged; funds held in custodial
escrow.</p>
<p>Completion signal:</p>
<p>Timebased jobs (e.g., hiring a model): Provider taps “Completed”
after session; client has 24–48h to confirm or raise a dispute.</p>
<p>Deliverablebased jobs (e.g., photo/video/creator posts): Provider
marks individual milestones (Shoot done → Proofs delivered → Finals
delivered) or single “Delivered” if simple. Client has review window per
milestone.</p>
<p>Autorelease: If no dispute is opened by the end of the window, payout
is autoreleased.</p>
<p>Payout timing:</p>
<p>Standard: Release 48h after completion confirmation (or window
expiry).</p>
<p>New provider risk policy: First X payouts delayed up to 7 days or
reserve % held to reduce chargeback/fraud risk; relax as reputation
builds.</p>
<p>Payout methods: Bank transfer (ACH) primary; backup options (PayPal,
etc.).</p>
<p>Tips: After completion (or milestone), buyer can add a tip (0%
platform fee on tips to encourage generosity).</p>
<p>E) Fee &amp; Pricing Strategy (Revenue model)</p>
<p>Goal: be simpler and fairer than legacy directories, with enough
margin to fund verification, support, and growth.</p>
<p>Recommended baseline (US launch):</p>
<p>Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal.</p>
<p>Buyer service fee: 5% (min $2).</p>
<p>Processing costs: Covered within these fees (we keep the math simple
for users).</p>
<p>Elastic incentives (drive behaviors we want):</p>
<p>Instant Book discount: Provider fee – 1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes “buy now”).</p>
<p>Verified boosts: Backgroundchecked providers get –0.5% fee and
ranking boost (ties to Trust incentives).</p>
<p>Highvalue tiering: For any single booking subtotal &gt; $1,000,
provider fee on the portion above that drops to 10%.</p>
<p>Alternatives to test (A/B later):</p>
<p>15% provider, 0% buyer (simpler, common in marketplaces).</p>
<p>8% provider, 7% buyer (shifts load to buyer; sometimes better
acceptance with pros).</p>
<p>We’ll start with the baseline, track conversion and sentiment, and
optimize. Promotions (e.g., zero buyer fee for first booking) can
accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>F) Changes, Overtime &amp; OnSet Additions</p>
<p>Overtime: In booking thread, either party can propose overtime in
30/60min increments at a preset rate; both tap to confirm; card is
incrementally charged; calendar extended.</p>
<p>Extras after checkout: Provider can offer postcheckout extras (e.g.,
“+10 edits”) as onetap upsells; buyer approves &amp; pays.</p>
<p>Travel/expenses: Preapproved extras (travel miles, parking, studio
rental). For adhoc expenses: upload receipt → buyer approves (or
dispute) → charge processed.</p>
<p>G) Rescheduling &amp; Cancellations (Policies)</p>
<p>Providers choose one of three policy templates per SP (or per
package). Buyers see the policy before paying.</p>
<p>Noshows &amp; late arrivals (defaults):</p>
<p>Noshow (buyer): 0% refund; provider may still be reviewed.</p>
<p>Noshow (provider): 100% refund + strike; buyer may review; provider
flagged for support review.</p>
<p>Grace: 15minute grace window; beyond that, time may be deducted or
counted as noshow per policy.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; force majeure exceptions:</p>
<p>Harassment, unsafe location, severe illness, natural events → Support
can override to full/partial refund; strikes applied accordingly. A
“safety cancel” reason shields public review text (but logs
internally).</p>
<p>Reschedule flow:</p>
<p>Either party proposes a new time; if accepted, booking updates.</p>
<p>If not accepted within policy windows, original cancellation terms
apply.</p>
<p>H) Disputes (Fair, timeboxed, evidencedriven)</p>
<p>When: Buyer or provider can open a dispute before payout (or within X
hours after if autoreleased; we’ll keep this window short).</p>
<p>What we collect (inthread):</p>
<p>Timeline: checkin/out times, chat logs, shared files, signed
contracts, location pin (if enabled).</p>
<p>Evidence uploads: screenshots, deliverables, RAW proof (when
relevant).</p>
<p>Resolution paths:</p>
<p>Noshow / not as described / deliverables missing:</p>
<p>Timebased jobs: prorated or full refund depending on attendance.</p>
<p>Deliverablebased: partial refund based on % of agreed deliverables;
or full refund if nothing delivered.</p>
<p>Partial performance: Mediation suggests partial settlement (we
generate a proposed split both can accept).</p>
<p>Bad faith / repeated issues: Strikes, suspension, or removal
(internal policy).</p>
<p>Outcome handling:</p>
<p>If settlement agreed → escrow splits accordingly.</p>
<p>If not → platform decides per policy &amp; evidence; decision is
final (per ToS).</p>
<p>Chargebacks: We retain evidence packets to contest with processor;
repeat chargebackers flagged.</p>
<p>I) Contracts &amp; Releases (Builtin)</p>
<p>Autoattach the right forms based on roles &amp; selected license:</p>
<p>Booking Agreement (scope, payment, cancellation, IP).</p>
<p>Model Release (for shoots with a model).</p>
<p>Usage License (creator → buyer; tiered).</p>
<p>Promotion Terms (for creators: posting dates, tags).</p>
<p>Esign at checkout (both parties).</p>
<p>Perbooking vault: Timestamped PDFs accessible to both; immutable
log.</p>
<p>Templates: We provide clear, plainlanguage templates; providers can
upload a Custom Addendum (subject to platform review).</p>
<p>J) AntiCircumvention &amp; Safety</p>
<p>Onplatform payments are required. Messaging attempts to share
external payment details trigger gentle warnings and, if repeated,
temporary messaging limits.</p>
<p>Why it’s better here: payment protection (escrow), cancellation
coverage, dispute support, verified reviews, DM credit incentives.</p>
<p>Emergency tools: Inthread “Safety flag” → prioritizes to Support;
optional checkin toggle that marks arrival/departure time &amp; general
area (not visible publicly).</p>
<p>K) Taxes &amp; Compliance (US launch)</p>
<p>We facilitate payments between buyer and provider and will follow
applicable tax reporting obligations as a marketplace facilitator (exact
thresholds can change; we’ll align with the processor’s reporting
workflow).</p>
<p>Sales tax: Most creative services are servicebased; taxability varies
by jurisdiction. The platform will support tax toggles per state/city
and adjust at checkout when applicable.</p>
<p>Yearend docs: Providers get a yeartodate earnings report and any
required tax forms via the payout provider dashboard.</p>
<p>We avoid giving tax advice; we provide the records and surface
processorlevel reporting where applicable.</p>
<p>L) Notifications &amp; Calendar</p>
<p>Email/push for: requests, invites, accept/decline, payment received,
reminder (24h/2h before), reschedule, dispute events, payout sent.</p>
<p>Calendar: 2way sync (readonly in MVP; writeback in Phase 2). ICS file
in confirmation email.</p>
<p>M) Provider &amp; Buyer Dashboards</p>
<p>Provider (per role + overall):</p>
<p>Next bookings; outstanding requests; required actions (confirm,
deliver, message).</p>
<p>Earnings (pending, available, lifetime), payouts history.</p>
<p>Policy &amp; pricing quick edit; Instant Book toggles; Autoaccept
rules.</p>
<p>Disputes center: upload evidence, view status.</p>
<p>Buyer:</p>
<p>Upcoming shoots; requests &amp; invites; Reschedule/Cancel; Add
extras; Leave review; Receipts and invoices.</p>
<p>N) Analytics Touchpoints (tiein to §1.2)</p>
<p>Booking funnel: Profile views → addtocart → request/IB → confirmed →
completed (per role).</p>
<p>Cancellation &amp; dispute rates (per policy, per package).</p>
<p>Revenue by package/extras/license (help providers tune offers).</p>
<p>Time to accept / response time (feeds search filters).</p>
<p>Promo impact: Track fee discounts vs. conversion and LTV.</p>
<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering &amp; QA)</p>
<p>Three booking modes fully functional (Instant Book, RequesttoBook,
Smart Invite), all roleanchored.</p>
<p>Escrow holds funds on accept/book; autorelease on completion with
dispute window.</p>
<p>Overtime and postcheckout extras can be added and charged midthread
with bothparty confirmation.</p>
<p>Cancellation policies selectable per SP (or package) and enforced
with prorated and exception handling.</p>
<p>Dispute center collects evidence, supports partial refunds, and logs
final decision.</p>
<p>Contracts &amp; releases autoattached and esigned at checkout; PDFs
stored with booking.</p>
<p>Fees applied per model (12% provider, 5% buyer) with Instant Book and
verification adjustments.</p>
<p>Payouts: standard delay 48h; newprovider reserve/delay policy
enforced.</p>
<p>Notifications &amp; calendar work endtoend (email + inapp; ICS
export).</p>
<p>Dashboards show accurate states and histories for both sides.</p>
<p>P) Rationale (why this will convert)</p>
<p>Fewer steps + Instant Book = more completed bookings.</p>
<p>Packages + optional extras clarify scope and upsell without
complexity.</p>
<p>Escrow + clear policies reduce buyer fear and provider noshow
risk.</p>
<p>Disputes with evidence keep support load manageable and outcomes
predictable.</p>
<p>Fee incentives nudge the behavior we want (Instant Book,
verification) while keeping takerate competitive.</p>
<p>Contracts bakedin prevent most misunderstandings that plague legacy
platforms.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.3 — Travel &amp; Distance Pricing &amp; Logistics
(FINAL)</p>
<p>1) Product goals</p>
<p>Make travel predictable and fair for both sides.</p>
<p>Prevent accidental longdistance bookings.</p>
<p>Keep Instant Book clean (no surprise costs).</p>
<p>Support true longhaul bookings with clear rules (day rates, lodging,
perdiem) without overcomplicating MVP.</p>
<p>2) Talent travel policy (per Service Profile)</p>
<p>Each SP (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator) sets:</p>
<p>A. Base location</p>
<p>Home city + map pin (hidden publicly; we show city/ZIPlevel to
users).</p>
<p>B. Included radius</p>
<p>e.g., 15 mi included (no travel fee). Buyer search defaults to
radiusfiltered results.</p>
<p>C. Travel pricing model (choose one)</p>
<p>Permile beyond included radius (e.g., $0.75/mi roundtrip, cap
optional), or</p>
<p>Pertime travel rate (e.g., $30/hr drive time), or</p>
<p>Zones (simple flat fees):</p>
<p>Local (≤ included radius): $0</p>
<p>Regional (e.g., 16–75 mi): flat $X</p>
<p>Outofarea (e.g., 76–150 mi): flat $Y</p>
<p>Longhaul (&gt;150 mi): Requestonly (no Instant Book), requires custom
quote (flight/train/hotel likely).</p>
<p>D. Longhaul rules (toggle per SP)</p>
<p>Travelday rate (if a day is lost to transit).</p>
<p>Lodging required (Yes/No; minimum star rating optional).</p>
<p>Perdiem (meal allowance) or “expenses at cost with receipts.”</p>
<p>Flight class policy (e.g., economy basic/economy).</p>
<p>These appear automatically when the distance exceeds the SP’s
Longhaul threshold.</p>
<p>E. Instant Book guardrails</p>
<p>Maximum travel distance/time eligible for Instant Book (e.g., ≤25 mi
or ≤45 mins driving).</p>
<p>Anything beyond becomes RequesttoBook (forces a
conversation/quote).</p>
<p>F. Touring calendar (optional)</p>
<p>Talent can publish “On tour” dates (e.g., “In Dallas Nov 12–13”).</p>
<p>On those dates, search treats them as local to that city (travel fees
suppressed/adjusted).</p>
<p>3) Buyer search &amp; guardrails</p>
<p>Default search radius (e.g., 25 mi) with a conspicuous “Expand
radius” toggle.</p>
<p>Results beyond the SP’s Instant Book limit display “Travel
required—Request to Book.”</p>
<p>“Visiting talent” toggle shows users who’ve set touring dates in the
buyer’s city/date.</p>
<p>If a buyer selects a date/location first, we prefilter to available
&amp; traveleligible profiles only.</p>
<p>4) Travel fee calculation (checkout)</p>
<p>We estimate distance/time using a mapping service (e.g., Distance
Matrix API) based on talent’s base location and the buyer’s shoot
location, then apply the SP’s chosen model (Permile/Pertime/Zones).</p>
<p>Line items at checkout:</p>
<p>Package price</p>
<p>Travel fee (breakdown: miles/time/zones)</p>
<p>Extras (if any)</p>
<p>License tier (if any)</p>
<p>Platform fee(s), tax (where applicable)</p>
<p>For longhaul: Instant Book disabled; buyer sees “Travel quote
required.” The request flow collects flight/hotel expectations and/or
“expenses at cost” consent.</p>
<p>Dallas ↔︎ Houston example (longhaul):</p>
<p>If distance exceeds SP’s Longhaul threshold (e.g., 150 mi), checkout
switches to RequesttoBook. The SP’s longhaul rules (travel day, lodging,
perdiem) appear automatically so both sides know the terms before money
is held.</p>
<p>5) Dayof transportation (local rides)</p>
<p>We considered offering buyers the option to prepay a rideshare for
talent. Here’s the practical approach:</p>
<p>MVP recommendation:</p>
<p>Do not directly book rides inside our app. Instead, let buyers:</p>
<p>Cover travel via the Travel fee (fixed &amp; predictable), or</p>
<p>Offer a “Local ride credit” addon (flat $ amount) that the talent can
use as they wish.</p>
<p>Why not deep rideshare integration for MVP?</p>
<p>Uber’s consumer Ride Request widget is deprecated; today they
recommend deep links to m.uber.com/app rather than thirdparty apps
creating rides endtoend.</p>
<p>Uber for Business and Vouchers API (and Lyft Concierge API) exist,
but they’re designed for enterprise programs (credits/vouchers/guest
rides), which adds account setup, policy, reconciliation, and support
overhead we don’t need at launch.</p>
<p>Phase2 option (if demand is strong):</p>
<p>Add an “Attach rides voucher” flow for enterprise buyers using Uber
for Business Vouchers or Lyft Concierge, where the buyer funds a capped
ride credit tied to the booking. We’d still keep our Travel fee logic
for nonvoucher cases.</p>
<p>6) Preventing bad bookings</p>
<p>Hard stops: If distance &gt; SP’s Max travel allowed, booking cannot
proceed (UI explains “Out of travel range; request a remote option or
choose visiting dates”).</p>
<p>Soft stops: If distance triggers longhaul, we force RequesttoBook and
surface the SP’s travel rules.</p>
<p>Calendar conflicts: Long travel times also block adjacent slots
(buffer) to avoid doublebooking.</p>
<p>7) Payments &amp; escrow for travel</p>
<p>Travel fees are part of the escrow amount and follow the same
cancellation/dispute policy as the job (unless flagged as nonrefundable
expenses after tickets/hotels are purchased with buyer approval).</p>
<p>For expenses at cost workflows (flight/hotel receipts): provider
uploads receipts → buyer approves → platform charges card and adds to
escrow or settles as a postcheckout extra.</p>
<p>8) UI copy (concise and proactive)</p>
<p>Search chips: “Local (≤ 25 mi)”, “Include traveling talent”.</p>
<p>Result badges: “Travel required—Request to Book”, “Visiting your city
on [dates]”.</p>
<p>Checkout: “Travel fee calculated from distance/time using talent’s
policy,” (ⓘ) tooltip with formula.</p>
<p>Longhaul panel: “This booking requires travel arrangements
(flight/hotel/perdiem). Send a request to confirm details.”</p>
<p>9) Acceptance criteria (travel)</p>
<p>SPs can configure Included radius, Travel pricing model, Longhaul
threshold/rules, and Instant Book limits.</p>
<p>Search respects radius by default and clearly marks travelrequired
results.</p>
<p>Checkout computes travel fee via distance/time API and shows a
transparent line item.</p>
<p>Longhaul disables Instant Book, requires RequesttoBook, and surfaces
travel rules.</p>
<p>“Local ride credit” addon supported; no rideshare booking in MVP.</p>
<p>(Phase2) Can attach Uber/Lyft vouchers for enterprise buyers.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.3 — Contracts, Releases &amp; Paperwork (Templates,
Requirements, Signatures) — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Make paperwork automatic, standardized, and enforceable—so
deliverables, rights, and usage are crystal clear without forcing every
user to lawyer up.</p>
<p>A) Smart Docs Engine (builtin, templatefirst)</p>
<p>Autoattach at booking: Based on roles in the booking, the platform
attaches a default pack of documents (below) prefilled with names,
dates, location, deliverables, fees, and licensing.</p>
<p>Esign builtin: Simple, legally binding esign (draw/type) with audit
trail (IP, timestamp, device).</p>
<p>Bringyourown: Providers/brands may upload custom addenda (PDF/DOCX)
to sign in the same flow.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction &amp; minors: City/state choice adjusts venue law; minor
flag adds guardian consent + stricter photo policy.</p>
<p>B) Minimum Document Set (autoselected)</p>
<p>Service Agreement / SOW (always): scope, timeline, payment schedule,
revisions, cancellation, dispute venue.</p>
<p>License/Usage Addendum (if media usage): media types, geos,
durations, paid vs organic, exclusivity options, optional workforhire
clause.</p>
<p>Model Release (if any model present): publicity rights grant; adult
vs minor variants; explicit nopornography covenant.</p>
<p>Property/Studio Release (if private or providerowned space):
permission to shoot, house rules, damages.</p>
<p>NDA (optional toggle from buyer): mutual or oneway.</p>
<p>Safety Addendum (if Nudity Tier &gt; Lingerie): attire/coverage,
chaperone policy, changing/privacy, closed set, onsite contact.</p>
<p>Defaults are editable by parties before signing; diffs logged.</p>
<p>C) When Are Docs Required?</p>
<p>Before checkin. All required docs must be esigned by both parties
before “Start” can be tapped in the app.</p>
<p>Brief stage: Buyers see the default pack preview on the brief;
providers see it when quoting.</p>
<p>No “paperless” bookings where releases are expected (e.g., shoots
with models).</p>
<p>D) Enforceability Hooks</p>
<p>Escrow gating: Funds won’t release until required docs are signed and
deliverables accepted.</p>
<p>Deliverables manifest references the SOW + License; disputes use
these as source of truth.</p>
<p>Audit trail: Signed PDFs with hash, IP/device/timestamps downloadable
by both parties.</p>
<p>E) Special Cases</p>
<p>TFP/Collab mode: SOW + noncommercial license by default; optional
upgrade to commercial later (with price).</p>
<p>Fansubscription creators: Adds Posting &amp; Attribution Addendum
(see §3.5 addendum) detailing deadlines and minimum live duration;
autoverify posts via OAuth/URL.</p>
<p>Minors: Guardian esign required; extra safety terms; no nudity tiers
available.</p>
<p>Union/agency talent: Upload agency rider; overrides conflicting
defaults where allowed.</p>
<p>F) Templates &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Platform maintains jurisdictionaware templates reviewed by counsel
(disclaimer: not legal advice).</p>
<p>Users retain rights per the signed License/Usage Addendum; platform
is not a party beyond payment terms and dispute venue.</p>
<p>G) Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>Smart Docs attach automatically by role; users can edit before
sign.</p>
<p>Esign with audit trail; PDFs stored &amp; versioned; available in
booking thread.</p>
<p>Checkin blocked until required docs are signed; escrow release
blocked without docs + acceptance.</p>
<p>Minor/guardian flows, safety addendum for nudity tiers,
property/studio release when applicable.</p>
<p>Addendum — §1.3 Booking, Payments &amp; Disputes (Studios
integration)</p>
<p>Goal: Integrate Studios (space listings) into booking &amp; payments
without complicating talent flows. Keep talent and studio as separate
bookings that can be purchased together in one checkout as a Linked
Booking Group. Preserve clear rules, escrow, deposit holds, and dispute
outcomes per type.</p>
<p>A) Booking Objects &amp; Linked Group</p>
<p>Two booking types:</p>
<p>Talent Booking (person-based:
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator).</p>
<p>Studio Booking (space-based: hourly rental with rules).</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group (LBG): if a buyer checks out with both a talent
and a studio, we create two bookings tied under one group ID.</p>
<p>Independent policies &amp; payouts per booking; the UI shows a group
summary.</p>
<p>Time sync: studio start/end must align to the talent schedule
(respecting min hours &amp; buffers).</p>
<p>B) Studio Checkout (what the buyer confirms)</p>
<p>Pricing line items: base $/hr × booked hours + min hours enforcement
+ cleaning fee (if any) + estimated taxes (if applicable) + deposit hold
(authorization, not captured).</p>
<p>Rules &amp; access: house rules, max capacity, noise policy, overtime
policy, loadin/out, door/access code (released after confirmation),
parking notes.</p>
<p>Smart Docs (autoattach): Property/Space Release + House Rules (sign
before checkin).</p>
<p>Address privacy: public page shows neighborhood; exact address and
access details reveal only after confirmation.</p>
<p>C) Instant Book vs Request to Book (studios)</p>
<p>Default: Instant Book ON (host may toggle “Approval required”).</p>
<p>Instant Book guardrails: Instant Book requires Studio Lite
verification or host ID verification (policy toggle).</p>
<p>Conflicts: if the studio is IB but the linked talent is requestbased,
the LBG holds the studio slot for X minutes while talent accepts.</p>
<p>D) Funds Flow: Escrow &amp; Authorizations</p>
<p>Talent booking: escrow per existing §1.3 rules.</p>
<p>Studio booking: escrow the studio rental amount at checkout.</p>
<p>Damage deposit: place a card hold (configurable per listing, e.g.,
$200–$1,000). Not counted in GMV; expires or is partially/fully captured
only upon a verified claim.</p>
<p>Cleaning fee: charged as part of studio subtotal (refundable only if
host cancels).</p>
<p>Payment method mix: both bookings appear on one receipt; behind the
scenes, we maintain two ledgers and two payouts.</p>
<p>E) Reschedules &amp; Edits (groupaware)</p>
<p>Propose change (buyer or provider/host): new time/date proposed to
both bookings in the LBG.</p>
<p>If both accept → times shift; Smart Docs autoamend; any price deltas
(e.g., longer hours) are quoted &amp; reauthorized.</p>
<p>If only one can move → buyer chooses to split the group (proceed with
one, cancel the other per its policy) or cancel both per each
policy.</p>
<p>Price adjustments:</p>
<p>Talent: change orders/addons as usual.</p>
<p>Studio: hours &amp; cleaning adjustments; additional fees quoted
before reauth.</p>
<p>F) Onsite Flow: CheckIn/Out &amp; Overtime (studios)</p>
<p>Checkin/out: geofenced Start/End taps; logs timestamps and
duration.</p>
<p>Overtime: billed per listing rule (e.g., per 30 min at 1.5×).</p>
<p>If overtime detected (End &gt; booked End), host files a PostBooking
Adjustment within 24h with evidence (checkout log, photos).</p>
<p>Buyer has 48h to accept/dispute; we may autoapprove if evidence is
clear (policy toggle).</p>
<p>Crew size overage / rule violations: host can submit an adjustment
claim with evidence within 24h (caps &amp; allowed reasons defined in
listing).</p>
<p>G) Cancellations, NoShows &amp; Safety (group and pertype)</p>
<p>Pertype matrices apply independently (talent follows talent policy;
studio follows studio policy).</p>
<p>Group UX: buyer sees a combined summary showing outcomes for each
booking.</p>
<p>Host cancel (studio): buyer gets 100% refund on studio + $25–$50
goodwill credit; talent booking remains unless buyer also cancels
it.</p>
<p>Safety exception: unsafe conduct → waive platform fees, refund
appropriately, and open Safety case; access to space can be revoked
remotely if applicable.</p>
<p>Noshow:</p>
<p>Studio: if buyer fails to check in within grace window and host was
present/available → studio payout per matrix; deposit not captured
unless damage or specific violation.</p>
<p>H) Damage Deposits &amp; Claims (studios)</p>
<p>Hold timing: authorize at checkout or 24h prior (host preference);
release 48h after checkout if no claim.</p>
<p>Claim flow: host opens claim within 24h with photos &amp;
description; amount requested up to hold cap.</p>
<p>Adjudication: Neutral Review may approve full/partial capture or
deny; capture appears as a separate charge (not escrow).</p>
<p>Abuse guard: repeated frivolous claims throttle host visibility and
may remove deposit privileges.</p>
<p>I) Completion &amp; Payouts</p>
<p>Studio completion trigger: autocomplete on successful checkout (no
deliverables).</p>
<p>Talent completion trigger: acceptance of deliverables or autoaccept
per §1.3/Delivery Room rules.</p>
<p>Payout timing:</p>
<p>Studio: 24–48h after checkout, minus adjustments under review.</p>
<p>Talent: 48h after acceptance/autoaccept.</p>
<p>Early Payout (peruse): available to eligible hosts/providers (Rep ≥
85) with the 0.5% acceleration fee as defined in §3.2 (peruse, not
subscription).</p>
<p>J) Receipts, Taxes &amp; Invoices</p>
<p>Unified receipt shows two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes (if
any), deposit hold (authorization only), and separate cancellation
policies.</p>
<p>Taxes: talent services vs space rental may differ by locale; we
surface hostprovided tax settings; lineitemized.</p>
<p>Documents: signed Smart Docs (Service Agreement, Property/Space
Release, House Rules) downloadable from the booking thread.</p>
<p>K) Edge Cases &amp; Safeguards</p>
<p>Doublebooking protection: instant revalidation of studio availability
at payment step; if collision, buyer gets a failsafe choice (waitlist or
alternative suggestions).</p>
<p>Early exit: no refunds for unused time unless host agrees; checkout
time is source of truth for overtime only (not undertime credits).</p>
<p>Access failures (e.g., bad code): host must provide alternate access
within 30 min; otherwise buyer may cancel for cause (full refund).</p>
<p>Travel fees: remain talentonly; no travel fees on studio
bookings.</p>
<p>L) Events &amp; Analytics</p>
<p>booking.create.talent|studio, booking.group.linked,
booking.group.split</p>
<p>studio.deposit.authorized|released|captured_partial|captured_full</p>
<p>studio.adjustment.opened|buyer_accept|buyer_dispute|resolved</p>
<p>checkin.start|end (role: studio/talent), overtime.detected</p>
<p>cancel.requested (who, when), cancel.outcome (per booking)</p>
<p>payout.scheduled|sent (per booking)</p>
<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.3 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>Two booking types implemented; Linked Booking Group supported in
checkout, thread, and receipts.</p>
<p>Studio checkout includes hourly pricing, min hours, cleaning fee,
rules &amp; access, Property/Space Release esign, and deposit hold.</p>
<p>Instant Book for studios with optional “approval required”;
guardrails for verification.</p>
<p>Reschedule proposes synchronized changes; buyer can split or cancel
with pertype policies applied.</p>
<p>Checkin/out geofenced for studios; overtime &amp; overage adjustments
flow live with evidence &amp; timers.</p>
<p>Damage deposit lifecycle (authorize → claim window → capture/deny →
release) implemented.</p>
<p>Completion &amp; payouts follow pertype triggers; Early Payout
(peruse) eligible for highrep accounts.</p>
<p>Receipts/invoices show separate lines &amp; policies; tax handling
surfaced; Smart Docs downloadable.</p>
<p>Edge cases handled (doublebooking, access failure, early exit, travel
fees talentonly).</p>
<p>Analytics events instrumented.</p>
<p>N) Why this works</p>
<p>Clarity &amp; fairness: Separate bookings keep policies, disputes,
and payouts clean—no crosscontamination.</p>
<p>Low friction: Instant Book + deposit holds match studio norms while
escrow preserves trust.</p>
<p>Group convenience: Linked groups let buyers plan shoots endtoend with
predictable outcomes if plans change.</p>
<p>Operationally sane: Evidencebased adjustments and timeboxed claims
keep support scalable.</p>
<p>SubSection 1.4 — Messaging, Inbox &amp; Collaboration UX</p>
<p>Goal: Make communication effortless and professional from first
contact through final delivery. Keep everything in one place, roleaware,
and bookingaware to cut backandforth, prevent misunderstandings, and
increase completed bookings.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Roleaware &amp; Bookingaware: Every conversation is clearly tied to a
role (Service Profile) and, when applicable, a specific booking.</p>
<p>Single source of truth: Chat, briefs, shot lists, files, contracts,
location, schedule, extras, and payments live inside the
thread/project.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; respectful: Read receipts, quick replies, templates, and
structured forms reduce friction and ambiguity.</p>
<p>Safety first: Prominent tools to report, block, escalate, and check
in; privacy by default.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention: Keep the value onplatform (escrow, protection,
reviews), while being transparent and fair.</p>
<p>B) Objects (data model at a glance)</p>
<p>Thread (id, type, role_context, participants, status)</p>
<p>Type: Inquiry (prebooking), Invite (Smart Invite), Booking
(postaccept), Dispute, System</p>
<p>Role Context: Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator (from the
Service Profile)</p>
<p>Status: Open • Awaiting reply • Pending decision • Confirmed •
Completed • Disputed • Archived</p>
<p>Message (sender, timestamp, content, attachments, system_flags)</p>
<p>Delivery states: sent (✓), delivered (✓✓), read (✓✓ filled)</p>
<p>Typing indicator, last active (e.g., “Active 2h ago”)</p>
<p>Attachment (file, type, size, hash, role_tags)</p>
<p>Images (JPG/PNG/WebP), Video (MP4/MOV), Docs (PDF/DOCX/XLSX),
Zip/RAR, Links (sanitized)</p>
<p>Project (exists for Booking threads)</p>
<p>Summary (package, extras, license), schedule, location, participants,
moodboard, shot list, call sheet, contracts, deliverables, milestones,
expenses, payments, travel, notes.</p>
<p>Action Cards (structured forms injected in chat)</p>
<p>Propose time / reschedule, add extras, add overtime, upload
proof/finals, request approvals, expense receipt, mark completed, open
dispute, share location, safety flag.</p>
<p>C) Inbox: layout &amp; organization</p>
<p>Layout:</p>
<p>Left pane: Folders + thread list</p>
<p>Center: Messages</p>
<p>Right pane: Project Panel (context &amp; actions)</p>
<p>Folders:</p>
<p>All, Unread, Starred, Inquiries, Invites, Bookings, Disputes,
Archived, Spam</p>
<p>Filters: by Role (Model, Photographer, …), by Status (Awaiting reply,
Payment pending), by City/Date, by Has files</p>
<p>Bundles: Threads are bundled by counterparty; expand to see separate
rolescoped conversations</p>
<p>Thread list item:</p>
<p>Avatar + Name, Role chip, Type chip (Inquiry / Booking / Invite),
Status chip, last message preview, unread count, date, read receipt icon
if your last message was read</p>
<p>Thread search:</p>
<p>Keyword search, file type filters, date range, role filter</p>
<p>Message requests:</p>
<p>Firsttime contacts land in Requests (under Inquiries) with Accept /
Decline / Block.</p>
<p>Bypass to Inbox automatically if sender meets your contact filters
(e.g., IDverified, inradius, budget disclosed).</p>
<p>D) Compose &amp; credits (spamsafe by design)</p>
<p>New conversation credits (monthly) per account, with bonus credits
from verification badges (as defined in §1.1).</p>
<p>Unlimited replies in existing threads and unlimited messaging for
confirmed bookings.</p>
<p>Contact filters: Talent can require IDverified only, budget
disclosure, or date provided to message.</p>
<p>Quick replies &amp; snippets: Providers can save templated responses;
we autosuggest based on context (“Thanks, I’m available that day—package
options attached”).</p>
<p>Message booster: For buyers, optional oneoff priority ping
(limited/charged) to nudge highdemand talent.</p>
<p>E) Thread header &amp; Project Panel (right pane)</p>
<p>Thread header (always visible):</p>
<p>Counterparty name + avatar; Role chip; Type chip; Status</p>
<p>Booking summary bar when applicable: date/time • location • package •
price • escrow status • policy</p>
<p>Project Panel tabs (Booking threads):</p>
<p>Summary: package, extras, license, price, escrow status, timeline
(proposal → accepted → shoot → delivery → review)</p>
<p>Schedule: date/time, buffers, reschedule button, ICS export</p>
<p>Location: map pin, parking notes; travel terms; share location
(toggle)</p>
<p>Participants: buyer, provider, assistants (optional), MUA/stylist
tags (FYI only); roles &amp; contact via chat</p>
<p>Brief: project description + structured brief fields (theme,
wardrobe, references)</p>
<p>Moodboard: pinned images/links, dragreorder, annotate with
comments</p>
<p>Shot List: checklist of shots; statuses (planned, in progress,
done)</p>
<p>Call Sheet: autogenerated PDF (time, location, contacts, setup notes,
schedule blocks, wardrobe list)</p>
<p>Files &amp; Deliverables: proofs, finals, RAW (if allowed); preview
&amp; approvals; watermarked previews until marked “accepted”</p>
<p>Contracts: booking agreement, model release, usage license, promo
terms (esigned PDFs)</p>
<p>Expenses: travel miles/time fees, receipts, approvals</p>
<p>Actions: add extras, add overtime, propose reschedule, cancel, open
dispute, mark complete</p>
<p>F) Collaboration features (in chat, zero friction)</p>
<p>Action cards render inline (mobilefriendly):</p>
<p>Propose new time → selector → both see Accept/Decline</p>
<p>Add extra (catalog) → confirm &amp; pay in one tap</p>
<p>Overtime (30/60min blocks) → both approve → charge</p>
<p>Upload proofs → gallery preview with Approve/Request changes</p>
<p>Upload finals → mark milestone “Delivered” → triggers release
timer</p>
<p>Expense receipt → buyer approve/pay</p>
<p>Share location (general area, not exact address unless both
consent)</p>
<p>Safety flag (see §H)</p>
<p>Annotations: On moodboard and shot list items, inline comments +
@mentions.</p>
<p>Pin message: Keep key messages at top (address, wardrobe, parking
code).</p>
<p>Labels &amp; notes: Private labels (“VIP”, “High budget”, “No
reshoots”) visible only to you.</p>
<p>Voice notes (Phase 2) and video call link (Phase 2) if needed—kept
lightweight.</p>
<p>G) File handling &amp; delivery guardrails</p>
<p>Supported types &amp; limits (MVP):</p>
<p>Images up to 25MB each; Videos up to 500MB; Docs up to 50MB; Zips up
to 1GB</p>
<p>Perthread storage cap (e.g., 10GB) with option to add more (paid or
Pro plan)</p>
<p>Preview &amp; watermark: Proofs autowatermarked (provider setting).
Finals unlock watermark once client taps Accept or escrow
autoreleases.</p>
<p>Large deliverables: Allow external links (Drive/Dropbox), autocapture
file manifest (name/size/checksum), and warn on expired links.</p>
<p>Versioning: When reuploading finals, keep prior version accessible
with timestamps.</p>
<p>Retention: Files retained for N months after completion (export
reminders sent before purge).</p>
<p>Copyright &amp; license: Display active usage license above
deliverables; warning if buyer requests use beyond license.</p>
<p>H) Safety &amp; moderation</p>
<p>Safety flag (red button):</p>
<p>Reasons: harassment, unsafe location, payment pressure, illegal
request, explicit content violations, impersonation, other.</p>
<p>Immediate priority route to Support; autosuspend of Instant Book on
the accused until triage; discreet handling.</p>
<p>Checkin: Optional “I’ve arrived / I’m leaving” timestamps; can share
general location radius with counterparty; private to thread &amp;
support.</p>
<p>Block &amp; report: One tap to block future messages; reporting
requires a short reason.</p>
<p>Automoderation:</p>
<p>Contact sharing &amp; offplatform payment detection → inline warning
+ educational tooltip (“You lose escrow protection, reviews, and
cancellation coverage offplatform”).</p>
<p>NSFW policy enforcement: image scanning + manual review queues for
suspected violations.</p>
<p>Privacy defaults: Email/phone hidden; reveal toggle after booking
(optional per user).</p>
<p>DND / Quiet hours: Peruser settings; requests still deliver silently
with summaries.</p>
<p>I) Anticircumvention (fair + educational)</p>
<p>Prebooking: External payment links/phrases prompt an educational
nudge and are softblocked; persistent attempts throttle sender’s
newconversation ability.</p>
<p>Postbooking: External coordination is allowed (we still encourage
onplatform for records); deliverables &amp; approvals should remain in
project for dispute coverage.</p>
<p>Value reminders: Periodic banners highlight benefits: escrow,
cancellation coverage, verified reviews, analytics, and search boost for
verified users.</p>
<p>J) Notifications</p>
<p>Push/email for: new message, invite/request received,
accepted/declined, payment captured, files uploaded, approvals
requested, reschedule proposal, dispute updates, payout sent.</p>
<p>Digest mode: For busy users, bundle notifications every X hours
unless “Booking day” (then realtime).</p>
<p>K) Roles &amp; permissions</p>
<p>Owner participants: buyer &amp; provider (full read/write).</p>
<p>Secondary participants (optional): assistants, MUA/stylist; invited
by owner; readonly or filesonly permission; cannot alter payments or
policies.</p>
<p>Tag &amp; consent workflow: When provider tags a collaborator on
media, that user receives an Approve/Decline card in chat; on approve,
media appears on both profiles (rolescoped per §1.2/§1.1).</p>
<p>L) Tieins to other modules</p>
<p>Booking &amp; Payments (§1.3): Add extras, overtime, expenses from
chat; payment capture + escrow state visible in header &amp; Project
Panel.</p>
<p>Search &amp; Profiles (§1.2/§1.1): Response time &amp; reliability
metrics update based on chat behavior (first response SLA, noshow,
delivery confirmations).</p>
<p>Verification (§1.1): Verified users get extra newconversation credits
and priority inbox surfacing.</p>
<p>M) MVP vs. Phase2</p>
<p>MVP</p>
<p>Unified inbox; roleaware threads; read receipts &amp; typing</p>
<p>Project Panel (Summary, Schedule, Location, Participants, Brief,
Moodboard, Shot List, Call Sheet, Files, Contracts, Expenses,
Actions)</p>
<p>Action cards (reschedule, extras, overtime, proofs/finals, expenses,
mark complete, dispute, safety flag)</p>
<p>File upload + watermark previews; external link capture</p>
<p>Safety flag, block/report, automoderation for offplatform
attempts</p>
<p>DND; message requests; contact filters; quick replies</p>
<p>Notifications + ICS export</p>
<p>Phase2</p>
<p>Voice notes; lightweight video calls</p>
<p>Shared whiteboard for lighting diagrams</p>
<p>Realtime coediting of shot lists</p>
<p>Deep calendar writeback (Google/Apple)</p>
<p>Enterprise attachments (brand asset libraries)</p>
<p>Uber/Lyft vouchers (only if enterprise demand)</p>
<p>Inthread AI assist (generate call sheet, summarize chat, draft
briefs)</p>
<p>N) Acceptance criteria (for engineering &amp; QA)</p>
<p>Unified inbox shows threads with role and type chips, filters and
bundles by counterparty.</p>
<p>Message requests workflow with Accept/Decline/Block; contact filters
honored.</p>
<p>Read receipts and typing indicators work across web &amp; mobile.</p>
<p>Project Panel exists for Booking threads with all tabs; data stays
synced with booking object.</p>
<p>Action cards execute: reschedule, add extras, add overtime, upload
proofs/finals with approvals, mark complete, expense approvals, dispute
open.</p>
<p>File handling: previews, watermarks (toggle), versioning, external
link manifest, storage caps.</p>
<p>Safety: safety flag escalates; block/report works; automoderation
nudges on contact/offplatform phrases.</p>
<p>Notifications &amp; DND behave per settings; ICS export for
schedule.</p>
<p>Response time &amp; reliability metrics update and feed search
filters.</p>
<p>Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, proper aria labels; attachments
preview alttext.</p>
<p>O) Rationale (why this will convert)</p>
<p>Role/booking context eliminates confusion for multirole users.</p>
<p>Project Panel centralizes everything—no lost emails, no conflicting
docs.</p>
<p>Action cards replace drawnout negotiation with onetap, auditable
steps.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; moderation reduce offplatform leakage and protect users,
increasing trust and repeat business.</p>
<p>Quick replies &amp; templates lower response time, boosting search
ranking and request acceptance</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.4 — ProviderManaged Changes &amp; Adminless Ops</p>
<p>Goal: Let User B (provider) modify an existing booking with zero
admin intervention—reschedule, change price, add/waive fees, issue
refunds—while preserving buyer consent, clear contracts, escrow
accuracy, and an immutable audit trail.</p>
<p>1) Change Types &amp; Consent Matrix</p>
<p>2) “Amendment” Object (Single Source of Truth)</p>
<p>Every approved change produces a versioned Amendment attached to the
Booking:</p>
<p>Fields changed (before → after), initiator, timestamp, reason code
(required), 双方 esign if it alters contractual terms (date, price,
deliverables, license).</p>
<p>PDF added to Contracts tab and to both receipts (for taxes and
disputes).</p>
<p>Audit trail (readonly) visible to both parties and Support.</p>
<p>3) Provider Portal — “Manage Booking” Actions</p>
<p>Propose New Time (Reschedule)</p>
<p>Date/time picker; optional note; shows buyer availability hints.</p>
<p>Autoapprove rules honored (see §5). Otherwise buyer gets
Accept/Decline card.</p>
<p>Apply Discount / Issue Partial Refund</p>
<p>Enter amount or %; choose reason (goodwill, less time, deliverables
adjusted).</p>
<p>Shows new totals, fee adjustments, and payout impact preview.</p>
<p>No buyer acceptance needed (refunds are onedirectional benefits).</p>
<p>Send Custom Offer Amendment (price ↑ / package swap / license
change)</p>
<p>Configure new package/price/deliverables; optional extras.</p>
<p>Buyer receives an Amendment Offer card to Accept/Decline.</p>
<p>Add Extras / Add Overtime</p>
<p>Standard action cards; buyer must accept.</p>
<p>Incremental charge collected; escrow updated; contract addendum
generated.</p>
<p>Adjust Travel (downward) / Waive Fees</p>
<p>Provider can lower/waive automatically calculated travel; cannot
increase without buyer acceptance.</p>
<p>Change Location</p>
<p>Pick new address; system recalculates travel. If cost rises, requires
buyer acceptance; if cost drops, autoapplies and notifies.</p>
<p>Issue Full Refund &amp; Cancel (Providerinitiated cancel)</p>
<p>Applies policy rules; may record a provider strike depending on
timing.</p>
<p>Buyer notified immediately; calendar unblocked.</p>
<p>All actions render as Action Cards in the thread and update the
Project Panel in real time.</p>
<p>4) Money Movement &amp; Fee Logic (Automatic)</p>
<p>Escrow up / down:</p>
<p>Increases (extras, upgrades): capture incremental charge on buyer
acceptance.</p>
<p>Decreases (discounts, partial refunds): reduce escrow instantly and
adjust platform fee prorata.</p>
<p>After payout:</p>
<p>Refunds become postbooking adjustments: provider authorizes a debit
(or we net from next payout). Buyer receives refund net of any
nonrecoverable processing costs per policy.</p>
<p>Platform &amp; processing fees:</p>
<p>Platform fees adjust proportionally to the final job value.</p>
<p>Processing fees follow processor policy; communicate clearly if some
fees are nonrefundable after a window.</p>
<p>Taxes:</p>
<p>Amendment updates taxable base where applicable; amended
invoice/receipt issued to both parties automatically.</p>
<p>5) Buyer AutoApprove Rules (Optional, SetandForget)</p>
<p>Buyers can preauthorize certain provider changes:</p>
<p>Time shift: autoapprove up to ±30/60/90 min same day.</p>
<p>Date move: autoapprove sameday or within X days window.</p>
<p>Location change: autoapprove within ≤ 5 miles of original.</p>
<p>Price decreases / discounts: always autoapproved.</p>
<p>Travel fee reductions/waivers: autoapproved.</p>
<p>No autoapprove for price increases, deliverable reductions, or
license downgrades.</p>
<p>This lets busy buyers give trusted providers flexibility without
constant taps.</p>
<p>6) Locks &amp; Fairness Windows</p>
<p>Hard Lock (e.g., &lt; 24h before start): Provider cannot unilaterally
change time/date; must request or cancel (policy applies).</p>
<p>Soft Lock (24–48h): Provider request requires buyer acceptance; if
declined, original stands or provider may cancel under policy (risking
penalty).</p>
<p>During session: Extensions via Overtime only (both accept).</p>
<p>After session, predelivery: Provider may apply discounts; increasing
price requires buyer approval.</p>
<p>7) Notifications &amp; Calendar</p>
<p>Buyer receives clear cards: “Provider proposes new time →
Accept/Decline”.</p>
<p>On acceptance, update both calendars, send new ICS, refresh Project
Panel timeline.</p>
<p>Decline returns parties to current terms; provider may propose
alternatives or cancel per policy.</p>
<p>8) Disputes Interplay</p>
<p>Amendments are authoritative in disputes.</p>
<p>If parties disagree on an unaccepted proposal, original terms
prevail.</p>
<p>Partial refunds/discounts applied by provider are final (cannot be
clawed back by provider through the UI).</p>
<p>If changes were forced outside rules (bug/abuse), Support can revert
via admin tools (audit trail shows all).</p>
<p>9) Abuse &amp; Rate Limits</p>
<p>Change attempt caps: e.g., max 3 pending proposals per booking at
once.</p>
<p>Cooldowns if repeated declines.</p>
<p>Provider score impact for excessive late reschedule attempts; affects
search ranking and Instant Book eligibility.</p>
<p>10) Examples (Concrete)</p>
<p>Provider shifts start time by 30 minutes (same day):</p>
<p>Buyer has autoapprove set to ±60 minutes → Instantly applied; ICS
updated.</p>
<p>Provider proposes moving shoot from Sat 10am to Sun 2pm:</p>
<p>Buyer must Accept/Decline; if decline, original remains; provider can
counter or cancel under policy.</p>
<p>Provider realizes commute is shorter; waives travel fee:</p>
<p>Applies immediately; buyer notified; escrow reduced; new receipt
issued.</p>
<p>Buyer asks for 10 extra edited photos after the shoot:</p>
<p>Provider uses Add Extras → Buyer accepts → card charged → escrow up;
addendum stored.</p>
<p>Provider wants to upgrade to “Premium Package” price:</p>
<p>Sends Custom Offer Amendment → Buyer accepts → incremental charge;
deliverables updated; new PDF.</p>
<p>Shoot ended early (90 min vs 2 hours):</p>
<p>Provider issues partial refund (30 minutes); buyer notified; payout
reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>11) Acceptance Criteria (QA)</p>
<p>Provider can initiate all actions above from “Manage Booking” with no
admin.</p>
<p>Consent rules enforced exactly as in matrix; autoapprove honored.</p>
<p>Amendments generated, versioned, and esigned where applicable; PDFs
attached.</p>
<p>Escrow &amp; fees recompute correctly for increases/decreases and
afterpayout adjustments.</p>
<p>Locks prevent lastminute unilateral changes; proposals respect
windows.</p>
<p>Calendars/ICS and notifications update on acceptance.</p>
<p>Audit trail shows who changed what, when, and why.</p>
<p>Abuse controls (caps, cooldowns, score impact) function.</p>
<p>12) Why this works</p>
<p>Providers get full operational control (no support tickets).</p>
<p>Buyers retain consent over anything that costs them more or gives
them less.</p>
<p>The platform keeps money math and contracts accurate—minimizing
disputes.</p>
<p>Autoapprove rules + locks make the system fast but safe.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.4 — Storage &amp; Deliverables (Large Files, External
Hosting, Feasibility) — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Support professional photo/video delivery (including sets in
the tens/hundreds of GB) without the platform bearing heavy
storage/egress costs. Keep acceptance/disputes solid by capturing
verifiable manifests and reviewquality previews.</p>
<p>A) Storage Model (Launch)</p>
<p>Hybrid by design</p>
<p>Small assets to platform (review quality): thumbnails, contact
sheets, lowres proxy video, PDFs; typical perfile cap ≤ 500 MB.</p>
<p>Originals offplatform (required for large sets): Google Drive,
Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, S3 presigned links owned by the provider.</p>
<p>External Delivery Modes (supported at launch)</p>
<p>OAuthconnected mode (preferred): Provider links Drive/Dropbox once.
We fetch file lists/metadata (name, size, modified, MIME, share URL),
generate a manifest and pin it to the booking.</p>
<p>Linkonly mode (no OAuth): Provider pastes share links (folder or
file). We crawl the listing (where permitted), and store a readonly
manifest (names/sizes/paths).</p>
<p>Checksum support: For platformuploaded items we compute hash; for
externals we store content length + etag (if available). Provider can
optionally paste SHA256 for each final file; we store/compare.</p>
<p>Review Previews (onplatform)</p>
<p>Photos: autogenerated webres JPEGs (e.g., long edge 2048px) for
client review.</p>
<p>Video: lowres proxy transcodes (e.g., 720p) for spotchecking
length/cut; no original uploads required.</p>
<p>Watermark policy: Watermarks allowed on previews; finals must be
watermarkfree (autocheck).</p>
<p>Retention &amp; Liability</p>
<p>Platform stores previews + manifests for 365 days; not a longterm
archive.</p>
<p>Providers must keep external links intact for at least 30 days
postacceptance (and until dispute window closes); after that, retention
is their responsibility per contract.</p>
<p>Security &amp; Access</p>
<p>Accepts tokenized share links and/passwordprotected links (password
stored encrypted).</p>
<p>We never mirror entire external folders by default. Limited,
ephemeral caching is allowed for preview generation only.</p>
<p>B) Delivery Room Rules (updated)</p>
<p>Manifest is truth: Acceptance/disputes reference the pinned manifest
(counts/specs/filenames/sizes).</p>
<p>Spec autochecks: Count, MIME/codec, pixel dimensions,
bitrate/duration, color profile; flags must be cured before acceptance
or go to dispute.</p>
<p>“All finals delivered” toggle: Provider asserts completeness; system
validates against manifest.</p>
<p>C) Provider Responsibilities (contractual)</p>
<p>Keep external links accessible through the review &amp; dispute
windows.</p>
<p>Supply accurate manifests and, where feasible, checksums.</p>
<p>Ensure clientready files are present in the deliverables folder at
acceptance.</p>
<p>D) Feasibility Notes (devlight)</p>
<p>OAuth scopes limited to readonly file metadata + download of preview
proxies; no destructive scopes.</p>
<p>Linkonly works dayone; OAuth can phase in.</p>
<p>For Drive/Dropbox API quotas, we ratelimit and cache manifests;
fallback to manual manifest upload if provider blocks API access.</p>
<p>E) Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>External delivery required for files &gt; 500 MB; platform generates
and pins manifests.</p>
<p>Preview generation for photos &amp; proxies for video; watermark
detection on finals.</p>
<p>Retention banners &amp; responsibilities shown; acceptance blocked if
required links are missing.</p>
<p>OAuth + linkonly ingestion; secure storage of tokens/passwords; no
bulk mirroring.</p>
<p>SubSection 1.5 — Trust, Safety &amp; Verification</p>
<p>Goal: Give every user confidence to book and meet new
collaborators—safely, transparently, and with minimal friction—while
protecting the marketplace from abuse, fraud, and policy risk. This spec
covers user verifications, badges, safety features, moderation,
enforcement, and operations.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Safety first, friction last: Strong protections with the fewest
possible extra steps.</p>
<p>Visible trust: Clear verification badges and reputation signals where
users make decisions (search cards, profile headers, checkout).</p>
<p>Evidence by default: Contracts, chat logs, checkins, and delivery
artifacts form a reliable record for disputes and incident response.</p>
<p>Least privilege: Share the minimum personal info needed; keep private
data private.</p>
<p>Consistency: Predictable policies, transparent outcomes, and
auditable decisions.</p>
<p>B) Policy Scope &amp; User Eligibility</p>
<p>Age: Platform is 18+ only at launch (simplifies compliance and
content policies).</p>
<p>Geography: US launch; future locales require local backgroundcheck
availability and legal review.</p>

illegal activity, sexual services, escorting, doxxing, offplatform
payment solicitation, explicit sexual content onsite,
intellectualproperty violations.</p>

studios for firsttime collaborations.</p>
<p>D3. Messaging Protections</p>
<p>Read receipts and last active to set expectations.</p>
<p>Automoderation for: slurs/harassment, sexual solicitations, payment
offplatform, contact info spam → inline warnings + throttles on
repeat.</p>
<p>Block &amp; Report (one tap) with categories and freetext; immediate
mute on both sides.</p>
<p>D4. Safety Flag &amp; Triage</p>
<p>Prominent Safety Flag in booking threads.</p>
<p>Highpriority queue for Trust &amp; Safety with SLA (e.g., triage
within 2 business hours; faster during shoots).</p>
<p>When flagged: temporarily disable accused user’s Instant Book and
Smart Invites until triage completes.</p>

<p>Strike policy: late cancels, noshows, policy violation
content/messages; expiry after X months.</p>
<p>F) Fraud, Risk &amp; Account Integrity</p>
<p>Risk scoring at signup and on each transaction: device fingerprint,
IP geolocation, velocity checks, mismatched card/name signals.</p>
<p>KYC for payouts: ID Verified + bank account name matching.</p>
<p>Hold &amp; reserves: Higher reserve or payout delay for new/untrusted
accounts, relaxing with reputation.</p>
<p>Duplicate accounts / ban evasion: Device &amp; identity correlation;
block on detection.</p>
<p>Chargeback defense: Autoassemble evidence packet (contracts, chat,
checkins, deliverables logs).</p>
<p>Anticircumvention: Heuristic detection of offplatform payments →
warnings → throttles → suspensions for repeat.</p>
<p>G) Operations Playbook (internal)</p>
<p>Triage Matrix:</p>
<p>Safety &amp; abuse (SLA fast) → specialized agents</p>
<p>Content moderation → queue with priority for NSFW edge cases</p>
<p>ID/Background verifications → automated + manual exceptions</p>
<p>Fraud/chargebacks → risk team with template evidence</p>
<p>Evidence Retention:</p>
<p>Booking artifacts (contracts, chat logs, checkins, deliverables
manifest) retained 12–24 months; extend on dispute.</p>
<p>PII access limited to T&amp;S and finance staff via rolebased
permissions.</p>
<p>Transparency &amp; Appeals:</p>
<p>Users get a decision summary for major actions (what policy, what
evidence).</p>

verified criminal activity onplatform).</p>
<p>H) Incentives that Make Safety “Pay”</p>
<p>Search boost tiers: ID Verified &gt; SocialVerified &gt; Trusted Pro
(highest).</p>
<p>DM credit boosts: +5 (phone), +10 (ID), unlimited newconversation
credits for Trusted Pro.</p>
<p>Fee perks (from §1.3): small provider fee reduction for Trusted Pro;
Instant Book discount.</p>
<p>Feature unlocks: Instant Book requires ID Verified; Autoaccept +
Smart Invites require ID Verified (and higher limits for Trusted
Pro).</p>
<p>I) UserFacing Safety Center</p>
<p>Guides: First shoot safety checklist, how to use contracts, what to
do if you feel unsafe, scam red flags.</p>
<p>Policies: Clear, nonlegalese summaries with links to full terms.</p>
<p>Contact support: Safety hotline (email/chat) with stated SLAs;
emergency escalation instructions.</p>
<p>Incident report form: Structured; encourages timely, detailed
reporting.</p>
<p>J) MVP vs Phase2</p>
<p>MVP</p>
<p>18+ only, baseline verifications (email/phone), ID verification to
unlock payouts/NSFW/Instant Book</p>
<p>Optional Background Check (“Trusted Pro”)</p>
<p>SocialVerified (connect IG/YT/TT)</p>
<p>NSFW gating &amp; automoderation for uploads/messages</p>
<p>Safety flag, block/report, checkin/out timestamps</p>
<p>Enforcement ladder &amp; strike logic; evidence retention
minimums</p>
<p>Risk scoring + payout holds for new providers</p>
<p>Phase2</p>
<p>Trusted Contact livelinks &amp; realtime safety pings</p>
<p>Devicelevel ban evasion detection refinements</p>
<p>Brand safety scoring for creators (keyword/image sentiment on linked
social posts)</p>
<p>Inthread identity recheck (selfie prompt) for suspicious flows</p>
<p>City “safe studios” network curation and promotion</p>
<p>Verified reference letters (offplatform clients/agencies with
proof)</p>
<p>K) Metrics &amp; Alarms (what we measure)</p>
<p>Trust adoption: % ID Verified, % Trusted Pro, % SocialVerified</p>
<p>Safety outcomes: incident rate per 100 bookings, average
timetotriage, repeat offender rate</p>
<p>Reliability: cancellation/noshow rates, ontime rates, response time
medians</p>
<p>Fraud: chargeback rate, offplatform attempt rate, duplicate account
hits</p>
<p>Impact: uplift in booking conversion for verified vs nonverified;
dispute rates by verification tier</p>
<p>Guardrail alarms: Incident spike over baseline, surge in offplatform
attempts, sudden drop in verification pass rates, abnormal dispute
clustering.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (for engineering &amp; ops)</p>
<p>Badge system live with Email/Phone/2FA, ID, Background, Social,
Studio, Reference statuses and UI tooltips.</p>
<p>Search filters &amp; ranking incorporate verification tiers and
reliability signals.</p>
<p>NSFW gating + automoderation for uploads/messages; human review queue
operational.</p>
<p>Safety Flag → highpriority triage with suppression of Instant Book
for accused until triage.</p>
<p>Checkin/out timestamps; optional generalarea pin; privacy defaults
respected.</p>
<p>Enforcement ladder &amp; strike counters with expirations; audit log
of actions.</p>
<p>Risk scoring, payout holds/reserves for new accounts; KYC gating
before payouts.</p>
<p>Evidence retention and export for disputes/chargebacks.</p>
<p>Safety Center content published; support SLA timers visible to
ops.</p>
<p>M) Why this will work</p>
<p>Visible trust reduces hesitation and increases conversion.</p>
<p>ID/Background checks + contracts make inperson shoots feel
professional and safe.</p>
<p>Automoderation + incentives keep money onplatform and lower support
load.</p>
<p>Evidencefirst approach shrinks dispute duration and chargeback
loss.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.5 (Trust)<br />
Trust, Safety &amp; Verification</p>
<p>Recommendation: Insert these as new subsections after your existing
verification stack and safety features (e.g., §1.5.G → §1.5.K). Leave
any search UI behavior in §1.2; keep definitions, badges, scoring,
safety flows here.</p>
<p>§1.5.G Studio &amp; Location Verification</p>
<p>Studio Verified (badge): owner uploads address + supporting document
(lease/utility/biz registration). Staff performs a onetime check. Badge
appears on profile; exposed to search as “Studio access: verified.”</p>
<p>Booking Location Verification (optional at checkout):</p>
<p>If buyer selects a known verified studio, no extra step.</p>
<p>Private addresses remain private; after acceptance, provider may
request location verification (lightweight place check). If
unresolvable, show a warning to both parties.</p>
<p>Touring calendar (from §1.2 travel): pairs well with verified studios
for safer first meetings.</p>
<p>§1.5.H References</p>
<p>Verified References (auto): created from completed onplatform
bookings (role + date). Contribute to reputation score.</p>
<p>Community References (optional): past collaborators can submit a
reference; recipient must approve; platform lightverifies metadata
(e.g., linked post/file). Lower weight; clearly labeled.</p>
<p>Search tiein: §1.2 exposes “Has verified references (≥ N)”
filter.</p>
<p>§1.5.I Reputation Score (0–100)</p>
<p>Purpose: oneglance confidence, without replacing detailed info.</p>
<p>Formula v1 (roleaware, timeweighted):</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; volume (rolespecific) — 40%</p>
<p>Reliability (ontime, completion, noshow, dispute rate) — 25%</p>
<p>Responsiveness (median first response time; consistency) — 10%</p>
<p>Verifications (ID, Background, SocialVerified, Studio) — 15%</p>
<p>Recent performance (last 90 days) — 10%<br />
Negative events (late cancels, noshows, dispute losses) reduce sharply
and decay over time.</p>
<p>Display:</p>
<p>Score ring + “Why this score?” breakdown.</p>
<p>Rolespecific and overall values (use role score in role search).</p>
<p>New users show “New — building reputation” (no penalty for being
new).</p>
<p>Search tiein: §1.2 adds Min Rep Score filter and Top Reputation sort;
Rep used as tiebreaker after core relevance factors.</p>
<p>Gaming protections: weight by review volume and recency; cap any one
factor; monitor anomalies.</p>
<p>§1.5.J Safety Expansions</p>
<p>Trusted Contact link (optional): share booking summary + checkin/out
timestamps with a designated contact via secure link.</p>
<p>Generalarea location share (100–150m fuzzing) during active bookings;
clear “stop sharing.”</p>
<p>Preshoot safety tips injected into chat 24h before firsttime
meetings.</p>
<p>Autosuppress Instant Book during active safety investigations.</p>
<p>Privacy for highprofile users: alias display names; reveal precise
address only after confirmation.</p>
<p>§1.5.K Acceptance Criteria (Trust addendum)</p>
<p>Studio Verified badge live; optional booking location verification
flow.</p>
<p>References: both Verified (auto) and Community (approval + lower
weight) displayed and factored into reputation.</p>
<p>Reputation Score computed, explained, visible (role &amp; overall),
and emitted as a signal to §1.2 for filters/sorting.</p>
<p>Safety enhancements: trusted contact, areashare, preshoot tips, and
InstantBook suppression are implemented.</p>
<p>🔁 CrossReferences &amp; Placement Notes</p>
<p>Keep API feasibility and platform lists under §1.2 (they power search
filters and profile chips).</p>
<p>Keep verification badge definitions, References, Reputation, and
Safety under §1.5; §1.2 only describes how search uses those
signals.</p>
<p>Paid Boosting: you added it here for visibility (good); the
commercial model, pricing, caps, and governance will be fully specified
later in Monetization &amp; Growth. §1.2 only defines how boosted
results render inside search (fairness rules).</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.5 — Trust &amp; Safety (Data &amp; Privacy) —
FINAL</p>
<p>Data minimization: Store attestations/metadata (manifests, hashes,
sign logs), not raw originals.</p>
<p>PII &amp; legal docs: Signed PDFs retained; access restricted to
parties + safety/legal on needtoknow basis.</p>
<p>External link hygiene: Encourage passworded links; warn about public
links; store passwords securely.</p>
<p>Addendum to §1.5 — Trust &amp; Safety</p>
<p>Policy &amp; Reputation Protection</p>
<p>Allowed: SFW content and artistic nudity (nonexplicit), promo posts,
teasers; collaborations with fansubscription creators as long as
onplatform media is nonexplicit.</p>
<p>Prohibited: explicit sexual content/acts, pornography,
escorting/sexual services, fetish content, “sexting” deliverables, paid
subscriber DMs/PPV facilitation.</p>
<p>Age &amp; ID: IDverified 18+ required to list as FanSubscription
Creator.</p>
<p>Visibility controls: Safe Mode default hides 18+ roles; user must
optin to view.</p>
<p>Enforcement: AI + human review; 3strike policy; instant adsuppression
and Instant Book disable during investigations.</p>
<p>Payments: Our mainstreamprocessor compliance is maintained (no
explicit content facilitated or hosted).</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria</p>
<p>Safe Mode default; age gate; explicitcontent detection in uploader;
rapid enforcement flows.</p>
<p>Addendum — §1.5 Trust &amp; Safety (Studios) — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Define clear, studiospecific safety, verification, privacy, and
policy rules that protect buyers, hosts, and talent—without diluting our
artisticonly content policy or Safe Mode behavior. Keep enforcement
predictable and tooling light.</p>
<p>A) Policy Scope &amp; Definitions (Studios)</p>
<p>Studio = Space Listing (placebased). Trust controls apply to the
space, not a person’s role.</p>
<p>Host = Account owner of a Studio listing.</p>
<p>Buyer = The party renting the studio (may be a brand, photographer,
or creator).</p>
<p>Artisticonly policy applies to all bookings: onplatform bookings may
include artistic nudity; explicit sexual content/acts are prohibited (no
adult content production facilitated or booked through the
platform).</p>
<p>B) What We Verify (Studio Lite)</p>
<p>Address &amp; Ownership/RighttoRent: government/utility/lease doc +
name match; geocode/place match.</p>
<p>Basic Safety Disclosures: max occupancy, egress, rules summary
(noise, strobe, haze, open flame, ladders).</p>
<p>Host Identity: host must be IDVerified; background checks (Trusted
Pro) remain peoplerole only.</p>
<p>Badge: passing shows Verified Studio.</p>
<p>Note: Studio Lite is not a building inspection or insurance
substitute; it’s a light authenticity &amp; disclosure check.</p>
<p>C) Required Documents &amp; Gating (per booking)</p>
<p>Smart Docs autoattach for Studio bookings:</p>
<p>Property/Space Release (host ↔︎ buyer)</p>
<p>House Rules (host authored; standardized fields)</p>
<p>Safety Addendum (if strobe/haze/open flame indicated)</p>
<p>Esign before checkin: access instructions (door code) unlock only
after signatures.</p>
<p>Minors: if talent under 18, Minor/Guardian Release required (already
in §3.5/§3.7); studios can display “No minors” if host policy
forbids.</p>
<p>D) Safe Mode &amp; Visibility</p>
<p>Safe Mode (18+) affects people profiles and feed content, not studio
visibility.</p>
<p>Studio photos and copy must remain SFW (no explicit imagery). It’s
acceptable to reference “suitable for fineart nude photography” if
aligned with policy.</p>
<p>E) OnSite Safety &amp; Conduct (baseline)</p>
<p>Arrival &amp; Checkin: geofenced checkin/out required for dispute
protection.</p>
<p>Chaperones: allowed unless host rules prohibit (hosts must state
policy clearly).</p>
<p>Boundaries: all onset conduct must respect talent boundaries and
house rules; harassment → immediate removal &amp; Safety action.</p>
<p>Loadin/out &amp; Crew Limit: must be honored; overages handled via
PostBooking Adjustment workflow.</p>
<p>Prohibited: explicit sexual acts, hate content, weapons discharge,
pyrotechnics (unless permitted &amp; declared), illegal substances.</p>
<p>F) Privacy, Cameras &amp; Sensitive Areas</p>
<p>Surveillance disclosure required: hosts must disclose all cameras
(fixed or smart).</p>
<p>No cameras in bathrooms, dressing/makeup rooms, or other private
areas—strict violation.</p>
<p>Consent signage: if any camera is present in a nonprivate area, host
must display a “recording in progress” sign.</p>
<p>Audio recording: must be disclosed; recording conversations without
consent is prohibited where unlawful.</p>
<p>G) Access, Security &amp; Emergency</p>
<p>Access methods: keypad/concierge/hostmeet; share instructions
postsigning.</p>
<p>Emergency contact: host phone provided postbooking; platform
emergency contact tile present in thread for P0 safety use.</p>
<p>Incident triage: Safety P0 (threat, medical, harassment) → immediate
hotline; IB &amp; boosts suppressed pending review.</p>
<p>H) Hazard &amp; SpecialUse Disclosures</p>
<p>Required rule toggles: strobe, haze/fog, loud audio, open flame,
ladders/scaffolds, wet floors, heavy props.</p>
<p>If toggled: Smart Docs adds Safety Addendum &amp; checklist; buyer
must acknowledge and assume responsibility to follow posted
procedures.</p>
<p>Open flame/pyro: disallowed unless local permits uploaded (attachment
field) and host allows.</p>
<p>I) Accessibility &amp; Accuracy</p>
<p>Accessibility attributes: stepfree access, elevator, restroom type,
door widths, parking.</p>
<p>Hosts must not misrepresent accessibility; repeated inaccuracies →
listing suppression and strike.</p>
<p>J) Insurance &amp; Deposits (clarity)</p>
<p>We do not provide insurance at launch. Hosts may require a COI upload
(optional field in booking thread).</p>
<p>Damage deposit (card hold): explained to buyer prepay; captured only
on approved claim (per §3.1/§3.9).</p>
<p>No platform fee on deposit captures; abuse (frivolous claims) →
penalties.</p>
<p>K) AntiDiscrimination &amp; Inclusion</p>
<p>Standard marketplace antidiscrimination applies to studio access
(protected classes).</p>
<p>Service animals: must be allowed where legally required; disclosure
needed for allergysensitive environments.</p>
<p>L) Enforcement &amp; Strikes (studiospecific)</p>
<p>Strikeworthy: hidden cameras / privatearea cameras, undisclosed
surveillance, unsafe conditions knowingly concealed, explicit content
facilitation, repeated access failures, repeated misrepresentation of
amenities/accessibility.</p>
<p>Interim measures: Instant Book disable, paid promotion suppression,
search throttling.</p>
<p>Remedies: require listing edits, additional disclosures, or
verification recheck.</p>
<p>Removal: severe or repeated violations → delist studio and potential
account suspension.</p>
<p>M) Safety UX Hooks (lightweight)</p>
<p>Preshoot tips injected to the thread 24h prior (“Bring a chaperone if
preferred,” “Share trusted contact,” “Review house rules”).</p>
<p>Trusted contact link: share session times &amp; generalarea location
with a designated contact (fuzzed to 100–150m).</p>
<p>Safety banner on studio detail page: “Read House Rules &amp;
emergency exit info on arrival.”</p>
<p>N) Acceptance Criteria (mark §1.5 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>Studio Lite verification requirements documented and enforced
(address/righttorent + disclosures + host ID).</p>
<p>Smart Docs (Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum when
applicable) autoattach; esign gating before access.</p>
<p>Safe Mode leaves studios visible; studio media SFWonly enforced in
uploader/moderation.</p>
<p>Surveillance &amp; privacy rules enforced: disclosure required; no
cameras in private areas; signage for any recording.</p>
<p>Hazard toggles present; Safety Addendum injected when toggled;
pyro/open flame restricted without permits.</p>
<p>Accessibility fields added; misrepresentation enforcement path
defined.</p>
<p>Emergency hooks (hotline, oncall), IB/boost suppression during
investigations.</p>
<p>Enforcement ladder (strike types, interim measures, removal)
implemented.</p>
<p>KB updates: “Studio Lite verification,” “House Rules &amp; Property
Release,” “Cameras &amp; privacy,” “Hazards &amp; permits,” “Deposits
&amp; claims,” “Artisticonly policy for studios.”</p>
<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Clear, minimal, enforceable: focuses on truths we can verify
(address, rules, cameras, hazards), not subjective promises.</p>
<p>Protects users &amp; brand: artisticonly boundary, privacy rules, and
strike ladder guard against the highestrisk scenarios.</p>
<p>Lowlift ops: Lite verification + templated docs + hazard toggles keep
support scalable while giving buyers predictable safety signals.</p>
<p>SubSection 1.6 — Support, Help Center &amp; Knowledge Base</p>
<p>Goal: Resolve user issues fast, fairly, and consistently—with the
lowest support overhead possible. Blend selfserve (knowledge base,
guided flows, inproduct smart prompts) with human support that’s
roleaware (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator), bookingaware, and
safetyfirst.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Selfserve first: Articles, guided troubleshooters, and contextual
prompts resolve 70%+ without tickets.</p>
<p>Inthread resolution: Most issues are solved inside the booking thread
(refunds, extras, schedule changes) via action cards, not email
pingpong.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; money prioritized: Safety; payment capture/escrow;
noshow/cancellation; disputes get elevated handling.</p>
<p>One source of truth: Contracts, chat, amendments, deliverables, and
receipts are the evidence for decisions.</p>
<p>Consistency over heroics: Clear policies, macros, and audit trails
keep outcomes predictable and defensible.</p>
<p>B) UserFacing Support Channels</p>
<p>Help Center (web + mobile web)</p>
<p>Public, SEOfriendly articles; rolefiltered navigation; search with

<p>Contextual launcher on key pages (Search, Profile editor, Checkout,
Messaging/Project Panel).</p>
<p>Surfaces top articles + guided flows (see §C).</p>
<p>Booking Thread → “Get help”</p>
<p>One tap opens guided issue forms that preattach the booking ID and
autopulls context (policy chosen, timestamps, files exchanged).</p>
<p>Safety Flag lives here too (escalates directly to T&amp;S).</p>
<p>Email form (fallback)</p>
<p>Web form that collects role, booking ID, category, severity; captures
device + browser autometadata.</p>
<p>(No phone support at launch; consider for enterprise later.)</p>
<p>C) Guided Flows (Decision Trees)</p>
<p>Purpose: Solve or autoprepare the case before an agent sees it.</p>
<p>Payments &amp; Payouts</p>
<p>“Charge failed” → suggest retry/readd method → if still failing,
create ticket tagged BILLING with last 4 of card, error code.</p>
<p>“Where is my payout?” → show payout timeline &amp; status → if past
SLA, open PAYOUTDELAY with booking and bankonfile.</p>
<p>Reschedule/Cancel</p>
<p>Walks buyer/provider through policy windows; if within selfserve
rules, triggers Reschedule or Cancel action card directly.</p>
<p>If outofpolicy, collects reason and evidence → creates
EXCEPTIONREQUEST.</p>
<p>Noshow/Late</p>
<p>Collects proof (checkin/out, chat logs); autocomputes default outcome
per policy; if contested, opens DISPUTE with attached evidence.</p>
<p>Deliverables/Quality</p>
<p>For missing finals: prompts provider to upload; starts a 24–48h
timer; opens MISSINGDELIVERABLES if timer expires.</p>
<p>For quality complaints: gathers specifics (what vs. agreed); suggests
partial settlement; creates QUALITYDISPUTE if unresolved.</p>
<p>Verification</p>
<p>ID verification help (photo tips, doc types); retries; escalates

<p>Section 2 — GotoMarket &amp; City Launch Plan</p>
<p>Expanding the business city by city requires a structured
go-to-market strategy combined with a detailed launch plan for each new
location. Successful geographic expansion is grounded in clear metrics,
phased milestones, and effective knowledge transfer to local teams. In
this section, we outline a comprehensive plan for entering new cities,
from initial market research through post-launch optimization, ensuring
each launch is executed efficiently and sets the stage for sustainable
growth.</p>
<p>2.1 Market Research &amp; City Selection</p>
<p>Before committing to any city launch, we will conduct in-depth market
research to select the right city and prepare a data-driven entry
strategy. Key factors to research include:</p>
<p>Local Market Demographics: Understand the target city’s population
characteristics and customer segments to ensure our product resonates
with local needs.</p>
<p>Competitive Landscape: Identify existing competitors or alternatives
in the city and benchmark their offerings and market share. This
analysis will highlight gaps we can fill and help position our service
effectively.</p>
<p>Regulatory and Legal Requirements: Check for any city-specific
licenses, permits, or regulations that could affect operations. For
example, some cities may require special permits for our services that
we don’t need in current markets, and we must secure these in advance to
launch legally and smoothly.</p>
<p>Operational Fit: Assess whether our current business model and
processes will work in the new city, or if we need adaptations. This is
especially crucial for an expansion into a very different market or
culture.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, financial viability will be evaluated for
each potential city. We will forecast the launch and operating costs
versus projected revenues to ensure the expansion makes economic sense.
Only cities that show a healthy opportunity (sufficient target customers
and manageable competitive pressure) will be chosen for launch.</p>
<p>Upfront preparation is also critical. Prior to expansion, we will
establish a clear set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and document
standard processes as the foundation for all city launches. These KPIs
(e.g. customer acquisition rate, monthly active users, local revenue,
etc.) define what success looks like in a new city. They enable us to
set measurable milestones for the launch (such as acquiring a certain
number of users or providers within the first 3 months). By having a
predefined KPI framework and playbook, we ensure each city launch is
measured consistently and can be managed against the same performance
benchmarks. Thorough documentation of processes (and automation where
possible) will allow rapid knowledge transfer to new teams and maintain
consistency as we replicate our model in different locales.<br />
<br />
2.2 Launch Team &amp; Local Operations Setup</p>
<p>To execute the city launch plan effectively, we will deploy a
dedicated city launch team and set up local operations in advance.
Rather than expecting each new city to figure things out independently,
a specialist launch team from the company will temporarily relocate to
spearhead the launch on the ground. This team may include experienced
members from our existing operations along with specialists (e.g.
marketing, community managers) who focus on new launches. Crucially, the
team will include a recruiter or HR lead who arrives about six weeks
early in the target city to start lining up local hires before the
official launch period. Hiring a local city manager and key operational
staff in advance ensures that when we launch, we have people who know
the area and can eventually take over daily operations.</p>
<p>During the initial weeks in a new city, the launch team will handle
tasks like securing any physical requirements (for example, a small
local office or storage facility if needed) and ensuring all logistics
and regulatory prerequisites are in place. This includes confirming
local permits or licenses have been obtained (as identified in the
research phase) and setting up any local partnerships or vendor
relationships needed for operations (e.g. local supply vendors,
last-mile logistics, etc.). Compliance with city regulations and laws
will be a priority before launch day, so that we enter the market on the
right side of local requirements.</p>
<p>We recognize that hiring the right local talent is pivotal to success
in a new market. The local team will ultimately run the city’s
operations after the launch team leaves, so we will take care to recruit
high-quality, proactive individuals who can operate with some autonomy.
Especially if the new city is far from headquarters, we need employees
who are self-starters and don’t require constant hand-holding. We will
not rush the hiring process or settle for sub-par candidates simply to
fill positions quickly; bringing on the right people (even if it takes a
bit more time) will pay off in smoother operations and better growth
post-launch. The recruiter on the launch team will focus on assembling
this local team early, so they can train alongside the launch experts
during the rollout period.</p>
<p>In summary, our go-to-market plan calls for a skilled launch
taskforce to establish each new city, build out local operations, and
hand over a well-functioning business to a carefully hired local team.
By front-loading the operational setup and knowledge transfer, we set
each city up with the tools, people, and processes it needs to thrive
from day one.</p>
<p>2.3 Localized Marketing &amp; Customer Acquisition Strategy</p>
<p>A one-size-fits-all marketing approach will not work for city
launches — each new city requires a localized go-to-market strategy
tailored to its audience and culture. Our marketing plan for city
launches will combine overarching brand messaging with hyper-local
tactics to quickly build awareness and user adoption in the new
market.</p>
<p>First, we will leverage digital marketing targeted to the specific
city. This includes geo-targeted online ads (social media, search
engines) focused on the city’s residents, and localized content on our
website or app store listings highlighting why our product/service is a
great fit for that city. We will also pursue local media coverage and PR
opportunities (press releases, local news features) to announce our
launch and explain the unique value we bring to the community.</p>
<p>Beyond digital channels, on-the-ground and community-focused
marketing will be key. We plan to engage in grassroots promotion such as
city-specific launch events, pop-up demos, or sponsorships. For example,
if launching a new service in a city, we might host a launch day event
or partner with a popular local festival to showcase our offering.
Forming partnerships with local businesses or influencers can greatly
accelerate word-of-mouth. One proven tactic is to go directly where our
target customers already congregate. For instance, when Oatly expanded
into a new market, they bypassed generic ads and partnered with local
coffee shops to reach their ideal customers at the point of purchase, a
strategy credited with helping their product gain rapid adoption (10x
revenue growth in one year). We will identify similar win-win
partnership opportunities in each city (whether it’s coffee shops,
community centers, universities, or other venues relevant to our target
demographic) to embed our product into the local lifestyle from the
start.</p>
<p>Our customer acquisition playbook in each city will be experimental
and responsive to local feedback. Each city has a unique culture and
what works in one market may not work in another. To account for this,
we will be prepared to test and iterate on marketing channels quickly.
Early in the launch, the team will test a range of channels – e.g.
social media campaigns, flyer distributions in high-traffic areas,
referral incentives, collaborations with local influencers – and double
down on those that show traction. As one startup founder notes from
experience, it’s important to “cycle through different customer
acquisition approaches because every new market is different”, and to
spend time on the ground learning “what makes a city tick” by seeing
things from the local’s perspective. In practice, this could mean our
team spends the first couple of weeks immersing in the city’s daily
life, talking to potential users, and understanding their needs and
habits.</p>
<p>We will also deploy creative grassroots tactics to spark initial
word-of-mouth. For example, one company found success by physically
going to a local flea market right after launch and pitching their
product directly to shoppers who fit their target profile, essentially
bringing the product to the customer at a point of need. In our case,
we’ll seek out comparable opportunities (whether it’s attending meetups,
weekend markets, or neighborhood events) to personally introduce our
service to early adopters. Such high-touch efforts not only drive early
user sign-ups but also show the community that we are invested and
engaged locally.</p>
<p>All these marketing efforts will be coordinated to create a surge of
awareness and adoption around the launch period. We aim to achieve a
critical mass of users in the first weeks, which will attract further
users through network effects and social proof. By combining targeted
digital campaigns with on-the-ground engagement and partnerships, our
go-to-market strategy ensures that each city launch quickly gains
momentum and establishes our brand firmly in the local market.</p>
<p>2.4 Launch Timeline &amp; Milestones</p>
<p>Executing a city launch will be done in phases with clear timelines
and milestones to keep the team on track. We will use a milestone-based
city launch plan that breaks the process into manageable stages from
pre-launch through post-launch. Below is an outline of the launch
timeline for each city:</p>
<p>Pre-Launch Preparation (T-minus 6 Weeks): Approximately six weeks
before the public launch, our advance team (especially the recruiter) is
on the ground in the new city. Key activities in this phase include
finalizing local hires, securing any necessary office space or
equipment, meeting with prospective partners, and launching initial
teaser marketing (e.g. “coming soon” campaigns). By the end of this
phase, we aim to have a trained local core team in place and all major
operational issues resolved before full launch.</p>
<p>Launch Execution (Weeks 1–4 of Launch): This marks the official
launch period when our service becomes available in the city. The city
launch team arrives in full to execute the playbook. In the first 4
weeks, the team focuses on hitting early milestones: onboarding initial
customers and/or service providers, ensuring service quality, and
monitoring KPIs closely (for example, reaching a target number of active
users or transactions by week 4). During this phase, the launch team
works hands-on alongside the new local hires, demonstrating processes
and solving problems in real time. We maintain a checklist of critical
milestones (e.g. system infrastructure stable, first 100 customers
acquired, first local partnership deal signed, customer satisfaction
above threshold) that should be achieved by the end of Week 4. Hitting
these targets confirms the launch is gaining traction as expected.</p>
<p>Knowledge Transfer &amp; Transition (Weeks 5–10): Around week 5, once
the initial launch goals are met, the focus shifts to transferring full
operational control to the local team. From Week 5 through Week 10, the
city launch team gradually steps back while coaching the local team to
handle all aspects of the business. During this transition, standard
operating procedures are reviewed, and any local adjustments are
documented. The launch team ensures the new team is comfortable with
maintaining quality and growth. By about the tenth week, our goal is
that the local team can run the city independently, with the central
launch team only in a support role. A final review is done at Week 10 to
decide if the city is on track (meeting the KPI targets set out) and if
the launch team can fully exit to focus on the next city.</p>
<p>Each phase has explicit milestones and deliverables, allowing us to
track progress and address issues promptly. This milestone-based
approach creates accountability and clarity – everyone knows what
“success” looks like at each stage of the launch. If a milestone is not
met (for example, if user acquisition falls short in Week 2-3), the team
can pause and troubleshoot or deploy additional resources to fix the
issue before proceeding. By structuring the city launch in phases, we
ensure a disciplined rollout and reduce the risk of launching without
the necessary foundations in place.</p>
<p>2.5 Post-Launch Monitoring &amp; Scaling Strategy</p>
<p>Launching in a new city is not the end of the process – it’s the
beginning of that city’s growth journey. After the initial launch and
handoff, we will have systems in place to monitor performance, support
the local team, and continuously improve our expansion playbook for
future cities.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will set up a city monitoring function to oversee the
health of all launched cities. This could be a small centralized team or
a regular review process that uses our KPI framework to track each
city’s metrics (e.g. growth rate, revenue, customer satisfaction)
against targets. The purpose is to ensure consistency and quality across
cities, catching any post-launch issues early. We may implement standard
compliance checks or quality audits (akin to an internal “city
operations QA” program) to verify that each city is maintaining our
service standards. For example, using a common framework or dashboard,
we can compare metrics across cities to identify any outliers or best
practices. If one city is excelling in a particular area (say, very high
customer retention), those tactics can be shared with other cities.</p>
<p>We will also encourage an environment of continuous knowledge sharing
among city teams. As the Times of India notes, effective expansion
relies on teams being “independent as well as centrally aligned and
sharing best practices”. To facilitate this, we’ll hold regular
cross-city meetings or calls (for instance, a bi-weekly “city leads
sync”) where city managers exchange learnings, challenges, and
successes. We will maintain an internal knowledge repository (wiki or
playbook documents) that gets updated with insights from each launch –
this may include refining checklists, marketing tactics that worked, or
pitfalls to avoid. These updates will continuously enhance our city
launch playbook. In fact, each new city provides an opportunity to
improve the model: for example, after launching in our second city, we
might refine our onboarding process or marketing strategy based on what
we learned, creating an even stronger template for the third city. Over
time, this accumulation of experience becomes a powerful asset, making
subsequent launches more predictable and efficient.</p>
<p>Another post-launch strategy is to foster some exchange of talent for
training and culture. We can have experienced team members from a
successful city spend time in a newer city to mentor the local team or
help instill best practices, and vice versa. This cross-pollination
ensures that our company’s culture and standards are consistently
spread, and it gives rising local stars a chance to learn in different
environments.</p>
<p>Finally, our expansion plan will take a sustainable growth approach.
We will only scale up to the next cities when ready, rather than
launching too many cities all at once. It’s important to avoid the trap
of growing too fast, too soon, which can strain resources and lead to
quality control issues. Each city launch will be evaluated against its
KPIs to ensure it’s stable (operationally and financially) before we
green-light the next launch. This paced expansion prevents high cash
burn and employee burnout that can come from aggressive, uncontrolled
expansion. By making sure we have the necessary resources (funding,
people, technology) in place for each new market, we protect the quality
of our service and brand reputation as we grow.</p>
<p>In summary, the post-launch phase focuses on consolidating success,
maintaining standards, and preparing for the next expansion. We will
continuously monitor each city’s performance and support the teams to
ensure ongoing success. Lessons learned will feed back into our
go-to-market strategy, allowing us to refine our approach with every new
city. This feedback loop and careful scaling strategy will enable us to
confidently expand our footprint city by city, while delivering a
consistent, high-quality experience in every market we serve.</p>
<p>Our go-to-market rollout will be executed in clearly defined phases
with measurable milestones. Phase 1 (current phase) covers our initial
launch in our first city (or region), which establishes our beachhead
and refines our core service. Assuming Section 1 covered the success of
our pilot market, we are now leveraging those learnings to expand
further. Phase 2 will consist of launching in the next set of
high-priority cities (Tier 1 markets from our selection process). We
anticipate launching in X new cities in the first 6 months of expansion,
focusing on cities that scored highest on our opportunity scorecard (for
example, [City A], [City B], and [City C]). These initial expansions are
milestone-driven: before moving on, we aim for each new city to achieve
key targets such as reaching Y active users and attaining a baseline
revenue or engagement level that proves local viability.</p>
<p>Phase 3 will expand to Tier 2 markets – a broader set of cities once
the playbook is validated in Phase 2. In this phase (perhaps months 6-18
of the plan), we might roll out to an additional N cities each quarter,
accelerating our coverage. Here we apply our tiered strategy: some
cities might be in "launch mode" focusing on user acquisition and
refining unit economics, while others (including our earliest markets)
graduate to "growth mode". Importantly, we will set different goals for
different stages: for example, a city in its first 3 months of launch
may target customer acquisition and awareness as the primary KPIs,
whereas a city in month 12 may target repeat usage and profitability.
Our plan explicitly accounts for these stage-based goals. As noted
earlier, soft launch vs. scale stages have different success metrics. We
will not prematurely force a new market to hit the same numbers as an
established one; instead, we track its progress against
stage-appropriate milestones (e.g., by month 3 post-launch, achieve X%
customer retention and an improving LTV/CAC trend).</p>
<p>Throughout the timeline, we’ll maintain a live roadmap of city
launches with key dates and criteria. A sample milestone plan could
be:</p>
<p>Q1 2024: Launch in 3 cities (A, B, C). Milestone: Each reaches 5,000
users and $50k monthly gross revenue within first 3 months.</p>
<p>Q2 2024: Launch in next 5 cities (D, E, F, G, H) using refined
playbook. Milestone: Reduce average customer acquisition cost by 20%
versus Q1 launches.</p>
<p>Q3 2024: Pause new launches to consolidate and improve operations if
needed (or continue with next wave if metrics are healthy). Milestone:
Achieve overall LTV/CAC &gt; 1.5 in at least 5 markets as a signal of
approaching profitability.</p>
<p>End of 2024: 8-10 cities live. Milestone: Prove the model can scale;
hit corporate revenue target of $X million from new markets.</p>
<p>(The exact numbers and cities are placeholders for planning purposes
and will be adjusted based on real-time feedback and results.) By laying
out a timeline with such milestones, we can track our progress and make
go/no-go decisions for each subsequent wave of expansion. If milestones
are met or exceeded, it’s a green light to continue scaling. If we fall
short in a particular city, we will troubleshoot and improve the model
before proceeding further, ensuring we don’t expand faster than we can
manage quality and performance.</p>
<p>Section 2.6 — Success Metrics &amp; Continuous Improvement</p>
<p>To ensure the Go-to-Market and city launch plan stays on track, we
will closely monitor success metrics and institute a cycle of continuous
improvement. Each city launch will be accompanied by a dashboard of KPIs
that measure how well our strategy is working. Key metrics include:</p>
<p>User acquisition metrics: number of sign-ups, activation rate (how
many of those sign-ups become active customers), and growth rate
week-over-week in the early months.</p>
<p>Supply-side metrics: number of service providers/partners onboarded,
their activity levels, and the supply-demand ratio (e.g. are there
enough drivers to fulfill ride requests within target wait times).</p>
<p>Engagement and retention: repeat usage rates, cohort retention of
customers after launch, and customer satisfaction/NPS scores in the new
city.</p>
<p>Unit economics: particularly LTV/CAC (Customer Lifetime Value vs.
Customer Acquisition Cost) in each city. We will track how this ratio
evolves as the city matures – initially it may be below 1 (as we invest
in growth), but our goal is to drive it above 1 (customers become
profitable) within a defined period. Achieving a healthy LTV/CAC is a
key signal that a city can move from launch phase to growth phase.</p>
<p>These metrics will be reviewed frequently (weekly during the initial
launch period, then monthly as the market stabilizes). If a city is
falling behind on any KPIs, the launch team and central team will
collaborate to diagnose issues and implement fixes. Because we
anticipate variance between cities, we won’t rigidly stick to an
expansion plan without adapting. As Instacart’s Boston General Manager
noted regarding expansion playbooks: a playbook is extremely useful as a
starting point, but every city is so unique that one must know when to
follow the recipe and when to trust one’s taste buds. In that spirit,
our team will constantly question assumptions and adjust our tactics to
local realities. Regular cross-city meetings will be held to share
lessons learned; what we learn in City A’s launch will refine how we
approach City B, and so on.</p>
<p>We will maintain a “living” city launch playbook document that is
updated continuously. This is not a static manual, but a collection of
best practices, checklists, and learnings that the launch team can
reference and contribute to. For instance, if a particular marketing
channel (say, college campus outreach) proved highly effective in one
city, we’ll note that in the playbook and consider employing it in
similar markets. Conversely, if we discover that a strategy didn’t work
in a city, we’ll document the context and caution for the future. The
goal is to make each subsequent launch more efficient and successful by
leveraging accumulated knowledge. As one founder described, their
playbook started as lessons from their first market and was “refined
with each city launch... giving a solid starting point when entering new
markets”. Our approach mirrors this philosophy of continuous
improvement.</p>
<p>Finally, success will also be measured at the macro level – how our
multi-city expansion contributes to the company’s overall growth and
market leadership. We expect that by following this GTM and city launch
plan, we will rapidly grow our user base and revenue. The ultimate
validation will be achieving dominant position in key markets. Companies
that executed disciplined expansion strategies have not only scaled to
hundreds of cities but often emerged as the category leaders in every
region they entered. We have the same ambition. By closely tracking our
metrics and iterating on our strategy, we’ll ensure that our expansion
is not just rapid, but also sustainable and strategically sound, paving
the way for long-term success.</p>
<p>Addendum to §2 — GotoMarket (Awareness without brand risk)</p>
<p>Dedicated landing page &amp; nav tile: “For FanSubscription Creators”
explaining SFW collaboration and promo tools; policy clarity
frontandcenter.</p>
<p>SEO/SEM language: use “FanSubscription Creator” / “Premium Content
Creator” rather than platform brand names in paid ads (reduces adpolicy
risk).</p>
<p>Partner channel: outreach to reputable agencies managing
fansubscription creators; offer Founding Creator perks (reduced buyer
fee on first collaboration, free ID verify).</p>
<p>Proof: case studies highlighting SFW collab shoots + verified promo
deliverables (no explicit media).</p>
<p>Addendum A §2 GotoMarket: Studios Launch Scope &amp; Emphasis
(ResearchUpdated)</p>
<p>Goal: Decide how (or if) “Studios” appears at launch without diluting
focus or overcompeting with Peerspace. Preserve our core: talent
discovery &amp; bookings. Use studios as a complementary, lowfriction
addon that increases conversion for shoots—not a coequal vertical on day
one.</p>
<p>A) Launch Positioning (what “Studios” means at MVP)</p>
<p>Name &amp; framing: “Verified Studios (Lite)” — curated creative
spaces and private studios suitable for photo/video shoots (not
events/parties).</p>
<p>Role in v1: Complementary to talent bookings. Studios appear as an
attachable option during briefs/checkout and as a subhub under Browse,
not a topnav pillar.</p>
<p>Geographic scope: Founding city only (e.g., Houston), seed 15–30
quality studios max; expand after PMF signals.</p>
<p>B) Why not a full “Peerspace competitor” at launch</p>
<p>Focus &amp; liquidity: Early marketplaces win by narrowing scope. A
full venue marketplace doubles complexity (supply ops, insurance,
deposits, map/amenity search, etc.).</p>
<p>Differentiation: Our edge is talent + tools (briefs, deliverables,
social metrics). Studios should amplify those flows (shoot readiness),
not become the main show.</p>
<p>Quality &gt; quantity: A curated set of creativeready spaces beats a
thin longtail that invites comparison to mature incumbents.</p>
<p>C) What ships for Studios at MVP (scope you can build to)</p>
<p>Surface &amp; discovery</p>
<p>Attach a Studio step in Brief and Checkout (city &amp; date
prefilled, filter by distance/price/amenities).</p>
<p>Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) subhub (not topnav): grid + map,
creative filters (natural light, cyc wall, blackout, ceilings, rates,
capacity).</p>
<p>Studio chips on talent profiles (“Has studio access” or “Owns
studio”) when applicable.</p>
<p>Booking model</p>
<p>Instant Book default (host can opt “approval required”). Hourly
pricing + min hours; overtime rules.</p>
<p>Escrow same as talent; damage deposit (card hold) optional per host;
cleaning fee allowed; rules &amp; access shown before pay.</p>
<p>Checkin/out with geofence &amp; door code field; QR access optional
later.</p>
<p>Verification (Lite)</p>
<p>Studio Lite (already designed in §3.4): doc OCR + geocode/Place
match; manual exception only.</p>
<p>Required docs: property/space release template + house rules
(autoattached via Smart Docs).</p>
<p>Payments &amp; fees</p>
<p>Same 12% provider / 5% buyer baseline (see §3.1), deposit holds not
counted as GMV.</p>
<p>Refund matrix follows space norms (stricter latecancel terms than
talent; see matrix below).</p>
<p>D) What we defer (postPMF)</p>
<p>Insurance marketplace, security deposits with offline inspections,
complex tiered amenities pricing, multilisting host dashboards, full
multicity inventory, eventuse cases.</p>
<p>Mapheavy discovery bells/whistles (streetlevel 3D tours, AR
walkthroughs).</p>
<p>Equipment rentals marketplace (separate future track).</p>
<p>E) Studio Refund &amp; Policy Matrix (v1 defaults; hosts may choose
stricter within bands)</p>
<p>Amenity overages (overtime/crew size): host may file PostBooking
Adjustments within 24h with evidence; buyer has 48h to
approve/dispute.</p>
<p>F) Marketplace Mechanics (how studios add conversion, not
complexity)</p>
<p>Brief uplift: when buyer composes a shoot brief, Attach a Studio
offers 3 nearby matches with “creative amenities” chips; increases award
rate by reducing buyer friction.</p>
<p>Talent crosssell: photographers who own a studio can toggle Studio
AddOn (hourly) inside their package; the system then exposes that studio
at checkout.</p>
<p>Boards: saved boards can include both talent &amp; studios; Compare
view keeps them separated by type.</p>
<p>G) Supply Seeding Playbook (first 30–60 days)</p>
<p>Curate 15–30 creative studios (natural light lofts, cyclorama spaces,
warehouse sets) in the founding city.</p>
<p>Fasttrack verification (Lite); waive Studio Lite fee for first
25.</p>
<p>Founding Host perks: Featured placement in Verified Studios (Lite)
carousel for 60 days; 0% buyer fee on first booking to stimulate
demand.</p>
<p>Quality bar: professional photos required; template rules; minimum
availability posting (2+ days/week).</p>
<p>Partnerships: local studio associations, photo schools, production
collectives.</p>
<p>H) Demand GTM Hooks</p>
<p>Bundle messaging: “Book the crew and the space in one place.”</p>
<p>Saved Searches: “Talent + Studio in [City] this weekend”
templates.</p>
<p>Case studies: showcase shoots that used both a Verified Studio and
onplatform talent; highlight time saved.</p>
<p>I) IA &amp; Nav Guidance (affects §4.0/§4.1 rewrites)</p>
<p>Browse ▸ Verified Studios (Lite) under Browse (not topnav).</p>
<p>Attach a Studio step in Brief/Checkout (primary place most buyers
will encounter studios).</p>
<p>Studio result cards use a distinct badge &amp; amenity chips; but
share card patterns with talent for consistency.</p>
<p>J) KPIs &amp; KillSwitches (90day postlaunch)</p>
<p>Attachrate: ≥ 20% of shoot briefs add a studio candidate.</p>
<p>Studioinvolved GMV: ≥ 15% of GMV involves a studio by month 3.</p>
<p>Fill rate: ≥ 50% of hosted studio slots receive at least one
inquiry/week.</p>
<p>Incident rate: damage disputes &lt; 1% of studio bookings.</p>
<p>Killswitch: If attachrate &lt; 8% and studio search CTR &lt; 2% for 8
consecutive weeks, hide Studios from Browse and keep only Attach in
Brief/Checkout; revisit supply fit.</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark Addendum A FINAL)</p>
<p>Attach a Studio step live in Brief and Checkout, prefiltered by
city/date.</p>
<p>Verified Studios (Lite) subhub live under Browse (grid + map);
creative amenity filters.</p>
<p>Studio booking: hourly + min hours, instant book default (host can
require approval), overtime rules, cleaning fee field, rules &amp;
access surfaced prepay.</p>
<p>Deposits: card hold configurable per listing; damage claim flow with
24h window.</p>
<p>Policies: studio cancel matrix implemented; host cancel strike/IB
pause wired.</p>
<p>Verification Lite flow for studios connected; property/space release
autoattached via Smart Docs.</p>
<p>Crosssell: studio chips on talent profiles when owned/linked; Studio
AddOn in photographer packages.</p>
<p>KPIs dashboards for attachrate, studio GMV share, incident rate;
killswitch automation.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Amplifies, doesn’t distract: Studios boost conversion of shoots
without turning us into a venue marketplace.</p>
<p>Curated &amp; creativeonly: We avoid the event/party longtail and
focus on spaces that matter to our users.</p>
<p>Operationally sane: Lite verification, instant book defaults,
deposits, and simple amenity filters keep v1 lean.</p>
<p>Option value: If traction pops, we can elevate Studios in the nav and
expand supply; if not, we gracefully tuck it behind “Attach” without
harming core flows.</p>
<p>SubSection 3.1 — Core Monetization Mechanics</p>
<p>Goal: Monetize in ways that increase trust and throughput, not
friction. Keep pricing simple, fair, and transparent; reward the
behaviors that grow the marketplace (verification, Instant Book,
reliability).</p>
<p>A) What we charge (and why)</p>
<p>1) Transaction (perbooking) economics</p>
<p>Provider fee (commission): 12% of booking subtotal (packages + extras
+ license + travel).<br />
Why: This benchmarks lower than creator marketplaces like Collabstr
(15%), Swipecast (15%), and Peerspace host fees (15–20%), while
remaining close to Upwork’s freelancer fee (10%)—so we’re competitive
for launch without undercutting our margins.</p>
<p>Buyer service fee: 5% (min $3); 3% when paid via ACH (once
available).<br />
Why: Buyer fees around 5–5.5% are common on large marketplaces (e.g.,
Fiverr 5.5% + a smallorder fee), and Upwork charges 3–5% depending on
payment method/plan. Our $3 minimum ensures we cover processing on small
bookings, and the ACH discount mirrors market norms and nudges lowercost
rails.</p>
<p>Processing costs: paid out of platform take (the buyer fee largely
offsets card fees at ~2.9% + $0.30 in the U.S.; ACH is lower). Note:
card processing fees from the original transaction aren’t returned on
refunds (industry standard).</p>
<p>Refund policy on fees:</p>
<p>If provider cancels or safety exception → refund buyer service
fee.</p>
<p>If buyer cancels per policy → service fee is nonrefundable (covers
payment ops &amp; support).</p>
<p>Provider fee adjusts automatically to the final job value after any
discounts/refunds.</p>
<p>Why this mix: Simple, predictable, and aligned with market
expectations and our earlystage unit economics. 5% buyer keeps us in
line with Upwork and below/near Fiverr’s charge to buyers; 12% provider
undercuts or matches comparable verticals.</p>
<p>2) Fee adjusters (nudge the right behavior)</p>
<p>Instant Book discount: Provider fee –1% on Instant Book transactions
(promotes “buy now”).</p>
<p>Trusted Pro (backgroundchecked) discount: Provider fee –0.5% (rewards
safety investment).</p>
<p>Highvalue tiering: On the portion above $1,000 in a single booking,
provider fee drops to 10% (keeps big jobs onplatform; echoes the “volume
discount” concept users recognize from legacy Upwork tiers).</p>
<p>Newmarket promos (timeboxed): e.g., $0 buyer fee on first booking in
a launch city; or –2% provider for first 60 days postlaunch.</p>
<p>All discounts are stackable with a floor (e.g., provider fee floor =
9%).</p>
<p>3) What we don’t charge for</p>
<p>DMs and inquiries (within fairuse credits; see §3.2).</p>
<p>Tips (0% platform fee on tips, paid postcompletion)—a clear
differentiator vs. platforms that take a cut of tips.</p>
<p>TFP/Collab Mode (no cash) — no commission; we monetize indirectly
(Pro, boosts).</p>
<p>B) Escrow, payout timing &amp; reserves (recap, monetization
lens)</p>
<p>Escrow on accept/book: we hold funds until completion/milestones (see
§1.3).</p>
<p>Payout timing: standard 48h after completion; newprovider reserve
(e.g., first 1–3 payouts delayed up to 7 days or 10% rolling reserve) to
reduce fraud/chargeback risk.</p>
<p>Early Payout (Pro preview for §3.2): selected providers with strong
Rep Score can receive same/nextday payouts for an optional 0.5%
payoutacceleration fee (applied to the provider fee component).</p>
<p>C) Worked examples (realistic, stepbystep)</p>
<p>We keep the math explicit so Finance &amp; Product implement
identical calculations.</p>
<p>Example 1 — $300 booking, default fees, no discounts</p>
<p>Booking subtotal: $300</p>
<p>Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 300 = $15 → Buyer pays $315</p>
<p>Provider fee (12% of $300): 0.12 × 300 = $36</p>
<p>Provider takehome (preprocessing): $300 − $36 = $264</p>
<p>Processor cost (illustrative): assume 2.9% + $0.30 on $315</p>
<p>2.9% of 315 = $9.135; + $0.30 = $9.435 (≈ $9.44)</p>
<p>Platform gross on this booking (before ops):</p>
<p>Revenue = provider fee $36 + buyer fee $15 = $51</p>
<p>Less processing ≈ $9.44 → Net ≈ $41.56.</p>
<p>Example 2 — $600 booking, Instant Book (–1%) + Trusted Pro
(–0.5%)</p>
<p>Buyer service fee (5%): 0.05 × 600 = $30 → Buyer pays $630</p>
<p>Provider fee base (12%): $72</p>
<p>Discounted provider fee (10.5%): 0.105 × 600 = $63</p>
<p>Provider takehome: $600 − $63 = $537</p>
<p>Platform revenue preprocessing: $63 + $30 = $93</p>
<p>Processing (2.9% + $0.30) on $630: $18.57</p>
<p>Net to platform (before ops): $74.43.</p>
<p>Example 3 — $85 booking, smallorder check</p>
<p>Buyer service fee: 5% of $85 = $4.25 (≥ $3 min, so min does not
apply) → buyer pays $89.25</p>
<p>Provider fee (12%): $10.20 → provider takehome $74.80</p>
<p>Processing on $89.25 (2.9% + $0.30): ≈ $2.89</p>
<p>Platform net (preops): (10.20 + 4.25) − 2.89 ≈ $11.56</p>
<p>On very small bookings (e.g., $30), the $3 min protects margin—where
many peers set $3–$3.50 smallorder addons.</p>
<p>D) Pricing transparency &amp; UX rules</p>
<p>Oneline disclosure at checkout: “Platform fees include secure escrow,
contracts, support &amp; payment processing.”</p>
<p>Provider dashboard “takehome preview” per package (and optional
“include estimated card fees” toggle).</p>
<p>Refund/discount edits autoreissue amended receipts for both sides
(see §1.4 addendum).</p>
<p>City promos show strikethrough fees (e.g., “Buyer fee ~5%~ → 0% this
month in Houston”).</p>
<p>ACH discount labeling: clearly show “Pay by bank (save 2% on fees)”
once ACH is enabled; this mirrors buyerside fee reductions on comparable
platforms.</p>
<p>E) Antileakage incentives (why pay through us)</p>
<p>Protection value: escrow, platform contracts/releases, dispute
handling, verified reviews, Pro analytics.</p>
<p>Economics: lower provider fee for Instant Book and Trusted Pro;
eligibility for paid Search Boost gated by onplatform performance.</p>
<p>Friction: gentle inchat warnings on offplatform payment attempts;
repeat attempts throttle newconversation sends (see §1.4/§1.5).</p>
<p>F) Edge cases &amp; policy notes</p>
<p>Dispute outcomes: platform retains the buyer fee only when buyer is
at fault; if we rule for the buyer due to provider fault, we refund the
buyer fee (mirrors common guest/host fee treatments).</p>
<p>Chargebacks: a disputehandling fee (e.g., $15) may be charged to the
losing party only in clear abuse; otherwise we absorb processor dispute
fees.</p>
<p>Taxes: where services are taxable, fees are calculated on the taxable
base appropriately; receipts itemize taxes separately.</p>
<p>NSFW policy alignment: mainstreamfirst (artistic nudity allowed),
enabling mainstream processors and avoiding adultcontent
surcharges/payout friction.</p>
<p>Refunds &amp; processor fees: card processing fees on the original
transaction are not returned by processors; our policy and tooling
reflect this.</p>
<p>G) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.1 FINAL)</p>
<p>Fee engine supports 12% provider + 5% buyer (min $3); ACH buyer fee
3%; stackable discounts (Instant Book −1%, Trusted Pro −0.5%, 10% on
portion &gt; $1,000) with floor 9%.</p>
<p>Buyer fee refunded on providerfault cancellations/safety exceptions;
nonrefundable on buyerinitiated cancels.</p>
<p>Payouts: 48h standard; newprovider reserve policy configurable by
cohort; Early Payout addon ready for §3.2.</p>
<p>Receipts/invoices autoupdate after amendments/discounts; totals
consistent with escrow.</p>
<p>Provider dashboard shows takehome preview; checkout shows clear fee
blurb + tooltip; ACH discount is surfaced when available.</p>
<p>Analytics capture net platform revenue per booking, fee mix, and
impact of discounts on conversion.</p>
<p>H) Why this works (postresearch)</p>
<p>Marketaligned: 12% provider sits below or near sector peers (15%+ on
Collabstr/Swipecast/Peerspace; Fiverr takes 20% from sellers), while 5%
buyer with $3 min mirrors buyer fees at Fiverr/Upwork.</p>
<p>Profitable from day one: buyer fee largely covers card processing;
smallorder min prevents negative unit economics; ACH discount reduces
payment costs and attracts highervalue buyers.</p>
<p>Growthpositive: discounts for Instant Book and Trusted Pro increase
conversion and safety; highvalue tier encourages larger jobs to stay
onplatform (a pattern users recognize from legacy fee ladders).</p>
<p>Addendum to §3.1 / §3.2 — Policy &amp; Pricing Notes (Storage &amp;
Docs)</p>
<p>Storage policy copy (customerfacing): “We store review copies and
paperwork for 12 months. Originals stay in your Drive/Dropbox. We’re not
a longterm archive.”</p>
<p>No storage fees at launch (per §3.2 StartFree strategy); external
hosting required for large deliverables.</p>
<p>Document access: Signed docs are always downloadable; we maintain
copies even if external links expire.</p>
<p>Dispute window: Contracts define a posting/delivery dispute window
(e.g., 7–14 days) during which links must remain live.</p>
<p>Addendum — §3.1 Core Monetization Mechanics (Studios) — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Apply our simple, trusted pricing (12% provider / 5% buyer) to
Studio bookings without ambiguity. Keep deposits outside GMV, align
refunds with studio policies, and preserve clean ledgers for Linked
Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout).</p>
<p>A) What we charge on a Studio booking</p>
<p>Provider (host) fee: 12% of the studio subtotal</p>
<p>Subtotal = hourly rental × booked hours + cleaning fee + paid addons
(e.g., furniture move)</p>
<p>Excludes taxes and deposit holds.</p>
<p>Buyer service fee: 5% of the studio subtotal (min $3)</p>
<p>ACH discount (when enabled): buyer fee 3% (min $3) if the buyer pays
via ACH.</p>
<p>Refund of buyer fee follows fault: refunded on hostfault cancel;
nonrefundable on buyer cancel per policy.</p>
<p>Processing costs: paid from platform take (same as talent).</p>
<p>No change to talent fees. Talent and Studio fees are computed on
their respective subtotals, even when purchased together.</p>
<p>B) Discounts &amp; nudges (studio)</p>
<p>Instant Book discount applies to Studio bookings: –1% on the provider
fee for IB transactions.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro (background) is peopleonly; does not apply to Studio
hosts.</p>
<p>Highvalue tier: the 10% provider fee above $1,000 threshold applies
per booking (talent and studio evaluated separately).</p>
<p>City promos (timeboxed) may separately reduce buyer/provider fees on
studio bookings; configured per city cohort.</p>
<p>C) What we do not charge on studios</p>
<p>Damage deposits (card holds) are not GMV; we do not take a platform
fee on deposit captures.</p>
<p>Postbooking damage captures (if approved) pass through to host; the
platform may still incur processor fees.</p>
<p>Tips (if we enable them for hosts) remain 0% platform fee.</p>
<p>D) Adjustments that are feeable</p>
<p>Overtime, crewsize overages, ruleviolation fees (when upheld) are
treated as booking adjustments → included in studio subtotal and feeable
at the same provider/buyer fee rates.</p>
<p>Change orders that extend hours or add paid items → feeable (computed
at approval time).</p>
<p>E) Linked Booking Groups (talent + studio in one checkout)</p>
<p>We create two bookings (one talent, one studio) under a Linked Group
ID.</p>
<p>Fees are computed per booking; buyer sees a unified receipt with two
sections (Talent • Studio).</p>
<p>Refunds/reversals apply per booking based on each policy; the group
summary presents the net outcome.</p>
<p>Processing may be a single charge or split under the hood; the ledger
remains separated to keep fee math transparent.</p>
<p>F) Refund policy alignment (studio vs talent)</p>
<p>Studio cancels (hostfault): 100% refund of studio charges; buyer
service fee for that booking refunded; goodwill credit per §3.9.</p>
<p>Buyer cancels: follow the studio matrix (e.g., &gt;7 days = 100%,
7–48h = 50%, &lt;48h = 0%); buyer fee nonrefundable.</p>
<p>Noshow (buyer at studio): host paid per matrix; buyer fee
nonrefundable.</p>
<p>Force majeure/safety: platform may waive fees and refund
appropriately (studio and/or talent) per §3.9.</p>
<p>G) Worked examples (clear math)</p>
<p>Processor assumption: ~2.9% + $0.30 per charge (illustrative). We
show platform preprocessing revenue and an approx net after processing
for transparency.</p>
<p>Example 1 — Studioonly booking</p>
<p>Rate: $100/hr × 4h = $400</p>
<p>Cleaning fee: $40 → Studio subtotal = $440</p>
<p>Buyer fee (5%): 0.05 × 440 = $22.00 → Buyer pays = $462.00</p>
<p>Provider fee (12%): 0.12 × 440 = $52.80 → Host takehome
(preprocessing) = 440 − 52.80 = $387.20</p>
<p>Platform revenue (preprocessing) = provider fee $52.80 + buyer fee
$22.00 = $74.80</p>
<p>Processing (est.) on $462: 2.9% × 462 = $13.398 ≈ $13.40; + $0.30 =
$13.70</p>
<p>Approx net to platform = 74.80 − 13.70 = $61.10</p>
<p>Deposit hold: $300 authorization (not charged, not GMV)</p>
<p>Example 2 — Linked Group: Talent $600 + Studio from Ex.1 (no
discounts)</p>
<p>Talent booking</p>
<p>Subtotal $600 → Buyer fee (5%) $30.00; Provider fee (12%) $72.00</p>
<p>Platform preproc rev $102.00; processing (est. on $630) $18.57 → net
≈ $83.43</p>
<p>Studio booking (from Ex.1)</p>
<p>Platform net ≈ $61.10</p>
<p>Combined (informational)</p>
<p>Platform preproc = $102.00 + $74.80 = $176.80</p>
<p>Approx processing total ≈ $18.57 + $13.70 = $32.27</p>
<p>Approx net ≈ $144.53</p>
<p>Buyer sees two buyerfee lines (talent $30, studio $22) and a single
receipt with two sections.</p>
<p>If Instant Book applies to talent and/or studio, reduce the
respective provider fee(s) by 1%; math updates accordingly. ACH payment
would reduce the buyer fee(s) to 3% where used.</p>
<p>H) Chargebacks &amp; deposit captures (studio specifics)</p>
<p>Representment for studio chargebacks includes: checkin/out logs,
rules acceptance, houserules esign, before/after photos, and adjustment
evidence.</p>
<p>Deposit capture (after approved damage claim) is a separate charge;
no platform fee applied; we still prepare evidence and may incur
processor dispute fees.</p>
<p>Repeated abusive claims by hosts or buyers trigger Rep penalties and
eligibility throttles (IB off, boost suppress).</p>
<p>I) Citybycity knobs (monetization safety)</p>
<p>Configure studioonly promos (e.g., 0% buyer fee on first studio
booking in founding city).</p>
<p>Optionally waive Studio Lite verification fee for first 25–50
hosts/city (CAC budget), not a permanent policy.</p>
<p>Keep provider fee floor = 9% after all discounts (applies
independently to talent and studio).</p>
<p>J) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.1 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>Provider 12% / Buyer 5% applied to Studio subtotal (cleaning/addons
included; taxes/deposits excluded).</p>
<p>IB –1% discount applies to Studio; Trusted Pro does not (peopleonly);
&gt;$1k tier reduces Studio fee portion to 10%.</p>
<p>Buyer fee refunds on hostfault cancels; nonrefundable on buyerfault
per studio matrix.</p>
<p>Deposit holds: not GMV; no platform fee on captures; lifecycle events
logged.</p>
<p>Overtime/overages/change orders feeable at standard rates when
upheld.</p>
<p>Linked Group receipts show two sections and two buyerfee lines;
ledgers remain separated; partial refunds handled per booking.</p>
<p>Analytics: revenue by type (talent vs studio), fee mix, ACH
penetration, discount impact, deposit claim rates, chargeback ratios by
type.</p>
<p>K) Why this works</p>
<p>Simple, predictable economics extend cleanly to studios; buyers see
clear line items, hosts see reliable takehome.</p>
<p>Margins protected: buyer fee offsets processing; deposits don’t
inflate GMV or distort fee math.</p>
<p>Scalable ops: perbooking ledgers + group receipts make refunds,
disputes, and reporting straightforward.</p>
<p>Aligned incentives: IB discount encourages fast conversion; fee tiers
keep highvalue bookings onplatform.</p>
<p>SubSection 3.2 — Pricing &amp; Tiers (Launch: Start Free, Grow, Then
Monetize in Layers)</p>
<p>Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings by removing monthly
paywalls and monetizing via takerate (see §3.1) and optional, usagebased
addons that never compromise fairness. Introduce an optional Pro tier
only after we reach liquidity and can prove it increases creator
revenue.</p>
<p>A) Principles (launch stage)</p>
<p>No subscriptions at launch — free to join, free to list, free to
message within generous fairuse.</p>
<p>Value is earned, not paywalled — verification, reliability, and
reputation unlock visibility and perks.</p>
<p>Payasyougo, not rent — Boosts/RFPs are usagebased; no forced
bundles.</p>
<p>Fairness &amp; safety first — paid visibility never outranks
relevance or safety gates.</p>
<p>Monetize later, when proven — add an optional Pro tier only after
clear, databacked ROI for users.</p>
<p>B) What everyone gets for free at launch (simple, generous)</p>
<p>Multirole profiles: up to 3 service profiles per account (Model /
Photographer / Videographer / Creator).</p>
<p>Portfolio &amp; storage: up to 100 images + 20 videos; 15 GB total
storage (pooled across roles).</p>
<p>Messaging: 40 newconversation credits/month (unlimited replies &amp;
all booking threads).</p>
<p>Booking stack: escrow, contracts/releases, licensing tiers; calendar
&amp; ICS sync; travel calculator (see §1.3).</p>
<p>Social metrics: connect IG/YT/TT/X; verified chips on profile &amp;
cards (see §1.2 addendum).</p>
<p>Fees: commission per §3.1 (12% provider; 5% buyer, $3 min, 3% ACH
when enabled).</p>
<p>No listing fees. No paid storage. No paid DM packs at launch.</p>
<p>C) Earned trust perks (free, but gated by safety/reliability)</p>
<p>1) ID Verified</p>
<p>Unlock Instant Book eligibility.</p>
<p>+20 newconversation credits/month (total 60).</p>
<p>Search nudge (minor tiebreak when results are otherwise equal).</p>
<p>Eligible for “Verifiedonly” buyer filters.</p>
<p>2) Trusted Pro (Background Check passed)</p>
<p>–0.5% providerfee discount (stacks with Instant Book –1%; floor 9%
from §3.1).</p>
<p>Priority in RFP request queues.</p>
<p>Onetime $15 Boost coupon (funded from CAC budget).</p>
<p>3) High Reputation (Rep ≥ 85; see §1.5)</p>
<p>Earned tiebreak in ranking after
relevance/availability/distance/price.</p>
<p>Early Payout eligibility (peruse; see §E).</p>
<p>Invite priority in Smart Invites.</p>
<p>None of these can be bought. They must be earned via verification,
reliability, and great reviews.</p>
<p>D) Usagebased monetization (optional; never paytowin)</p>
<p>1) Search Boost (CPC with daily caps)</p>
<p>Promotes cards only in queries the provider already matches.</p>
<p>Labeled Promoted; strict density limits (≤2 in top 20; ≤1 above the
fold).</p>
<p>Eligibility: ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no recent strikes.</p>
<p>2) Featured Carousels (fixedterm)</p>
<p>City/category home modules (e.g., “Featured in Houston”).</p>
<p>Weekly flat price; slot caps; guaranteed rotation.</p>
<p>3) RFP Broadcast Credits (for buyers/teams)</p>
<p>Post a brief (role, city, budget) → broadcast to matching verified
providers.</p>
<p>Sold in small packs (e.g., 5 for $29). Replies remain free.</p>
<p>4) Optional buyer ACH discount</p>
<p>Buyer fee 5% (min $3) → 3% when paying via ACH once enabled (mirrors
norms, reduces costs; see §3.1).</p>
<p>E) Early Payout (peruse, not a plan)</p>
<p>Eligibility: Rep ≥ 85 and ID Verified or Trusted Pro.</p>
<p>Pricing: 0.5% per accelerated payout (applied to the providerfee
component only), charged only when used.</p>
<p>Limit: Max once per booking; no stacking.</p>
<p>F) Storage &amp; deliverables (no paywall at launch)</p>
<p>Base 15 GB for all; 30 GB when ID Verified; 50 GB when Trusted Pro or
Rep ≥ 85.</p>
<p>Large sets can use external links (Drive/Dropbox); platform captures
a manifest (name/size/checksum) for disputes.</p>
<p>Revisit storage billing only if &gt;5% of active users routinely hit
ceilings and costs materially increase.</p>
<p>G) Messaging health &amp; antispam (no paytospam)</p>
<p>Monthly 40 newconversation credits; +20 for ID Verified; +20 for
Trusted Pro (max 80).</p>
<p>Credits autoreplenish monthly; extra credit purchases disabled at
launch.</p>
<p>“Nudge” limit: 1 priority nudge / thread / day; abuse throttled;
repeated violations reduce newconversation caps.</p>
<p>H) Fairness &amp; ranking guardrails (immutable)</p>
<p>Relevance first: query fit → availability → distance → price → Rep
tiebreak → Verified/Trusted nudges.</p>
<p>Paid visibility caps: strict density limits; clear Promoted labels;
never outrank better matches.</p>
<p>Safety gating: Boosts &amp; RFP broadcasts require ID Verified, Rep ≥
70, no recent strikes.</p>
<p>I) Launch promos (transactionfirst; timeboxed by city)</p>
<p>0% buyer fee on first booking in launch cities.</p>
<p>–2% provider fee for first 60 days postlaunch (stackaware; respects
9% floor).</p>
<p>Verification subsidies: cover part of ID cost for the first 300
signups/city; $15 coupon on passing Background.</p>
<p>City promos rendered as strikethrough on fee lines (e.g., “Buyer fee
~5%~ → 0%”).</p>
<p>J) When (and only when) to add an optional Pro plan later</p>
<p>Introduce a voluntary Pro tier only if all triggers are true in ≥ 2
launch cities:</p>
<p>Liquidity: Search→Inquiry ≥ 20%; Inquiry→Booking ≥ 35%; Repeat
bookings ≥ 30%.</p>
<p>Willingness to pay: ≥ 20% of active providers repeatedly buy
Boosts/RFP credits.</p>
<p>Pro uplift proof: Piloted Pro features show ≥ 20% conversion/GMV lift
vs. control.</p>
<p>Community health: NPS ≥ 45 and Pro does not depress Free
engagement.</p>
<p>If/when launched: keep Pro optional and valueadd (e.g., monthly Boost
stipend, advanced analytics, concierge), never required for
discoverability.</p>
<p>K) Metrics to watch (prove we chose right)</p>
<p>Activation: % of new providers publishing ≥ 1 package within 7 days →
&gt; 50%.</p>
<p>Messaging health: Median first response time ≤ 2 hours; abuse reports
&lt; 0.3 / 100 conversations.</p>
<p>Verification adoption: ID ≥ 60%, Trusted Pro ≥ 15% by day 60 in a
city.</p>
<p>Unit economics: Booking net (per §3.1) positive in ≥ 95% of
transactions; smallorder min protects margin.</p>
<p>Boost ROI: Median paid Boost yields ≥ 2.5× incremental GMV.</p>
<p>Repeat: 30%+ repeat bookings within 90 days in mature launch
city.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance criteria (to mark 3.2 FINAL)</p>
<p>No subscriptions at launch; no paid storage; no paid DM packs.</p>
<p>Feature gates/perks are driven by Verification, Trusted Pro, and
Reputation, not payment.</p>
<p>Search Boost, Featured, RFP credits implemented as usagebased with
eligibility gates, labels, and density caps.</p>
<p>Early Payout available peruse for qualified providers.</p>
<p>Storage tiers increase via verification/reputation; externallink
manifesting implemented.</p>
<p>Messaging credit system live; abuse throttles; “nudge” limits
enforced.</p>
<p>Launch promos configurable per city/cohort (fee holidays, provider
fee reductions, verification subsidies).</p>
<p>Dashboards: activation, verification adoption, Boost ROI, unit
economics, response times, repeat bookings.</p>
<p>M) Why this works (launch economics &amp; growth)</p>
<p>Removes adoption friction that hurt legacy platforms (no “pay to
participate”).</p>
<p>Aligns incentives — we profit when users profit (commission), not
before.</p>
<p>Builds trust at scale — earned perks (verification/reputation) boost
safety and conversion.</p>
<p>Keeps options open — once liquidity and ROI are proven, we can add an
optional Pro that power users want to pay for.</p>
<p>Notes for §3.1 consistency (already reflected)</p>
<p>Keep 12% provider / 5% buyer (min $3; 3% ACH); Instant Book –1%,
Trusted Pro –0.5%, highvalue tier 10% above $1,000; floor 9%.</p>
<p>Early Payout is peruse (0.5%) and eligibilitybased — not tied to any
subscription.</p>
<p>SubSection 3.3 — Paid Boosting &amp; Promotions (UsageBased Only)</p>
<p>Goal: Unlock incremental bookings and early revenue without harming
trust or liquidity. Paid visibility is optional, eligibilitygated,
clearly labeled, and strictly capped. Organic relevance remains the
primary ranking signal. We pilot quietly (Houston) and scale only if
metrics prove netpositive.</p>
<p>A) Principles (grounded in research)</p>
<p>Fairfirst, never paytowin. Organic ranking = query match →
availability → distance → price fit → Rep Score. Paid units never
displace more relevant organic matches.</p>
<p>Eligibility before dollars. Boosts only for proven, trusted providers
(ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed onplatform bookings or ≥1 verified
reference, no active safety flags).</p>
<p>Transparency &amp; control. Every paid unit is labeled Promoted with
a “Why am I seeing this?” explainer; buyers can Hide a provider and
Report.</p>
<p>Hard caps &amp; guardrails. Strict density, frequency, and
impressionshare caps; qualityscore weighting; misrepresentation =
autopause.</p>
<p>Pilot, measure, earn the right to scale. Quiet Houston beta → expand
only if we hit growthsafe KPIs (organic share, buyer CTR/conv, provider
ROAS) and no trust regressions.</p>
<p>B) Inventory &amp; Placements (v1, minimal &amp; conservative)</p>
<p>Search Results Boost (primary)</p>
<p>Placement: results list.</p>
<p>Format: standard profile card + Promoted chip + dynamic ribbon (e.g.,
“Instant Book”, “Trusted Pro”, “Available this week”).</p>
<p>Density caps: ≤1 Promoted abovethefold, ≤2 Promoted in top 20
results.</p>
<p>Category / City Featured Carousels (home &amp; landing)</p>
<p>Modules: “Featured in Houston”, “Featured Photographers”.</p>
<p>Slots: 10–12 cards, rotating evenly; visible only in the pilot
city.</p>
<p>Not in v1: inbox/proposal boosting, email ads, push highlights. We do
not boost RFP proposal order or message thread ranking (avoids
“paytowin” backlash).</p>
<p>C) Products &amp; Pricing (usagebased, no bundles)</p>
<p>Search Boost (CPC)</p>
<p>Pilot floors (illustrative): TierA city (Houston) — Models $0.90,
Photographers $0.70, Videographers $0.80, Creators $0.85.</p>
<p>Budgeting: daily budget + max CPC; even pacing; prepaid wallet;
charge on valid clicks only.</p>
<p>Ordering (within paid caps only): Score = 0.5×log(bid) +
0.5×QualityScore.</p>
<p>Featured Carousel (flat weekly)</p>
<p>Pricing: $49–$89 / week (Houston, by role).</p>
<p>Delivery: impression guarantees; rotation fairness; makegood credits
if short.</p>
<p>No subscriptions, no longterm commitments, no forced packs.</p>
<p>D) Eligibility, Targeting &amp; Relevance (what keeps it fair)</p>
<p>Eligibility: ID Verified, Rep ≥ 75, ≥2 completed bookings (or ≥1
verified reference), no active safety flags, policycompliant
content.</p>
<p>Query matching (hard filter): role, location radius, availability
window, price range, NSFW toggle must all match; otherwise no
delivery.</p>
<p>Audience targeting: provider may narrow by city/radius/price band;
negative keywords/genres allowed.</p>
<p>QualityScore (0–1): exact filter match, recent response rate/time,
Rep, Instant Book, price fit to query median, historical CTR/conv. New
boosters start at 0.5.</p>
<p>E) Rotation, Frequency &amp; ShareofShelf Caps</p>
<p>Frequency caps (per buyer): max 2 paid impressions/session, 5/day, 4h
cooldown per provider/buyer pair.</p>
<p>Provider impressionshare cap: paid impressions per provider ≤8% of
all eligible paid impressions/day (prevents domination).</p>
<p>Organic share guardrail (platformwide): at least 85–90% of buyer
result clicks must land on organic cards in the pilot (monitored
KPI).</p>
<p>Roundrobin within caps: if eligible &gt; slots, rotate weighted by
(remaining budget × QualityScore).</p>
<p>F) Provider Experience (setup → proof of value)</p>
<p>Setup flow: pick service profile → choose Search Boost or Featured →
set budget &amp; bid → (optional) narrow targeting → confirm.</p>
<p>Creative policy: no custom ads; we use the profile card + system
ribbon (prevents deceptive creative).</p>
<p>Guidance: “Suggested bid” and “expected clicks/bookings” estimates;
“Improve QualityScore” checklist (ID verify, reduce response time,
enable Instant Book, adjust price fit).</p>
<p>Reporting (realtime): impressions, clicks, CTR, avg CPC, inquiries,
bookings, GMV attributed, ROAS, and incremental lift via a 10% holdout
(eligible but not shown).</p>
<p>Autocoaching: if 7day ROAS &lt; 1.5×, show “Consider pausing or
improving QS” prompt; if &lt;1.0× after 14 days, recommend pause.</p>
<p>G) Buyer Experience (clarity &amp; control)</p>
<p>Labeling: Promoted chip + info tooltip (“Matches your filters;
purchased limited promotion. Promoted never outranks more relevant
results.”)</p>
<p>Controls: Hide this provider (suppresses organic &amp; paid for 30
days), Report (routes to Safety).</p>
<p>Consistency: paid units respect NSFW settings and all filters;
density caps enforced above.</p>
<p>H) Fraud, Safety &amp; Abuse Controls</p>
<p>Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, bot/device
anomalies, selfclicking, rings → automark invalid &amp; credit back CPC;
repeated anomalies throttle delivery &amp; flag for review.</p>
<p>Misrepresentation: price/availability mismatches or baitandswitch →
autopause campaign + warning; repeat → suspension.</p>
<p>Safety linkage: any active safety investigation → suppress all paid
delivery until cleared.</p>
<p>Budget protection: daily overspend guard (≤5% variance) + autocredit
on pacing errors. Chargeback shield: new campaigns disabled if
unresolved chargebacks.</p>
<p>I) Launch Posture &amp; Comms (Houston pilot)</p>
<p>Access: inviteonly cohort of 100–200 eligible providers per role in
Houston for first 6–8 weeks.</p>
<p>Messaging to community: publish an Integrity Pledge (fairfirst, clear
labels, hard caps, eligibility gates).</p>
<p>Feedback loop: inproduct survey after 2 weeks of spend; provider
&amp; buyer focus groups at week 4; adjust caps/floors accordingly.</p>
<p>Reinvestment: earmark 20–30% of pilot Boost revenue to buyer
acquisition in Houston (drives net liquidity).</p>
<p>J) KPIs &amp; “Kill Switch” Thresholds (first 60–90 days)</p>
<p>Adoption &amp; performance</p>
<p>≥ 12–18% of eligible providers try Boost; Featured weekly slot fill
≥60%.</p>
<p>Median ROAS ≥ 2.5×; median costperbooking ≤ $18 (TierA).</p>
<p>Buyer experience &amp; trust</p>
<p>Organic click share ≥ 85–90% (guardrail).</p>
<p>Buyer Hide rate ≤ 3% of paid impressions; Safety reports ≤ 0.2 /
1,000 paid impressions.</p>
<p>No significant drop in search→inquiry or inquiry→booking vs. prepilot
baselines.</p>
<p>Fairness &amp; ecosystem health</p>
<p>Gini index of paid impression distribution stays below threshold (no
provider monopolies).</p>
<p>Nonboosted, highRep providers maintain stable inquiry rates
(±10%).</p>
<p>Kill switch (autopause) if any occur:</p>
<p>Organic click share &lt; 80% for 7 rolling days; or</p>
<p>Buyer Hide rate &gt; 5% for 7 days; or</p>
<p>Incremental bookings (holdout) ≤ 0 for 2 consecutive weeks; or</p>
<p>Spike in safety reports tied to promoted cards.</p>
<p>K) Pricing Governance &amp; City Tiers</p>
<p>City tiers: TierA (Houston, Dallas, LA, NYC, ATL) → TierB (growing
metros) → TierC (smaller metros).</p>
<p>CPC floors review: monthly; adjust ±$0.10–$0.20 based on fill,
provider ROAS, and buyer CTR/conv.</p>
<p>Featured pricing review: quarterly by impressions delivered, CTR,
bookings/slot.</p>
<p>L) What we won’t do (explicit guardrails)</p>
<p>No boosting of proposals/RFP response order or message thread
prominence.</p>
<p>No “unverified” or lowRep accounts in paid slots.</p>
<p>No unlabeled or disguised ads.</p>
<p>No auction in v1 (simplicity first); we may test a hybrid bid × QS
auction later if/when liquidity warrants.</p>
<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.3 FINAL)</p>
<p>Search Boost (CPC) live with city+role floors, daily budgets,
validclick billing, even pacing.</p>
<p>Featured Carousel live with weekly flat pricing, rotation, impression
guarantees &amp; makegoods.</p>
<p>Eligibility gates enforced (ID, Rep ≥ 75, booking/reference minimums,
no safety flags); query match hard filter; NSFW compliance.</p>
<p>Caps: density (≤1 above fold; ≤2 in top 20), frequency (2/session,
5/day, 4h cooldown), provider impression share ≤ 8%/day.</p>
<p>QualityScore &amp; ordering implemented; fair roundrobin pacing;
organic share guardrail tracked.</p>
<p>Fraud &amp; safety: invalidclick credits, overspend guard, autopause
on misrep/safety.</p>
<p>Reporting: realtime KPIs + holdoutbased incrementality; autocoaching
on low ROAS.</p>
<p>Admin tools: floors, slot caps, guardrails/kill switch, makegood
credits, cohort gating.</p>
<p>Comms: Integrity Pledge published; buyer labeling &amp; controls
shipped; feedback loop live.</p>
<p>N) Why this works (for launch)</p>
<p>Protects growth: Paid units are sparse, vetted, and relevancebound;
early users see that quality wins without paying.</p>
<p>Aligns incentives: Providers can optin to spend when it pays; we
prove incremental bookings via holdouts, not just clicks.</p>
<p>Avoids known pitfalls: No inbox/proposal boosting (sidesteps
“paytowin” backlash); strict caps prevent ad overload.</p>
<p>Scales responsibly: Pilot → prove → expand. If metrics or sentiment
sag, kill switch lets us pull back instantly.</p>
<p>SubSection 3.4 — Verification &amp; Compliance Monetization</p>
<p>Goal: Maximize early adoption and bookings while raising trust. Use
automationfirst verification with manualexception only, verify at
milestones (not at signup), and absorb essential costs during launch.
Store attestations (Pass/Fail) rather than raw PII.</p>
<p>A) Principles (launch posture)</p>
<p>Frictionlight, milestonegated. No heavy checks at signup. We trigger
verification only when it unlocks value or reduces risk (e.g., Instant
Book, first payout, privateaddress shoots).</p>
<p>Automation first, humans last. Use vendor SDKs (doc scan, liveness,
geocode) and OCR to autoapprove the vast majority; route only fails/edge
cases to a small ops queue.</p>
<p>Platform absorbs essential costs (launch). Treat ID checks as
customer acquisition and trust investment; revisit after liquidity.</p>
<p>Privacy by design. We keep outcome + timestamp + vendor; vendors hold
sensitive artifacts.</p>
<p>Explainable &amp; fair. Clear consent, reasons, appeals. No
protectedclass logic.</p>
<p>Citylevel dials. Subsidy, triggers, and badge rules configurable per
launch city.</p>
<p>B) The Verification Ladder (what, when, why)</p>
<p>Tier 0 — Account Basics (always free)</p>
<p>Email + phone (SMS) verify, device fingerprint, IP risk screen.</p>
<p>Badge: New — building trust. Limited DM credits (see §3.2).</p>
<p>Tier 1 — ID Verification (unlocks value; platformpaid at launch)</p>
<p>Triggers (any of): enable Instant Book; accept first paid booking;
release first payout; host at a private address (nonstudio); exceed
monthly newconversation cap.</p>
<p>Method: gov ID scan + selfie liveness + fraud checks (SDK).</p>
<p>Unlocks: ID Verified badge, Instant Book, +20 DM credits, minor
search tiebreak (equal matches).</p>
<p>Refresh: every 24 months or on risk events.</p>
<p>Tier 2 — Background Check (“Trusted Pro”, optional; passthrough
priced)</p>
<p>Triggers: optin for Trusted Pro badge; required for certain sensitive
categories if ever added.</p>
<p>Method: SSN trace, national criminal/sexoffender, sanctions;
countylevel where indicated by vendor logic.</p>
<p>Unlocks: Trusted Pro badge, provider fee –0.5% (see §3.1), RFP
priority, onetime $15 Boost coupon.</p>
<p>Refresh: 12 months or on risk events; FCRAstyle adverse action +
appeal flow.</p>
<p>Tier 3 — Studio Verification (optional; “Lite” first)</p>
<p>When: user wants a Studio Verified badge or frequently sets their own
space as the shoot location.</p>
<p>Lite (MVP, automationheavy): address claim + one supporting doc
(lease/utility/biz registration) → OCR + name/address match +
geocode/Place lookup → autoapprove if match confidence high; manual
review only on fails.</p>
<p>Full (defer to Phase 2): optional remote video walkthrough or
thirdparty inspection for highvolume venues.</p>
<p>Unlocks: Studio Verified badge; search filter “Studio access:
verified”; fastpath location selection at checkout.</p>
<p>Social Verification (optional, free)</p>
<p>OAuth to IG/YT/TT/X; nightly sync metrics → verified chips and
perplatform search filters (see §1.2 addendum).</p>
<p>Age/NSFW Eligibility (derived)</p>
<p>Age derived from Tier 1; enables artisticnudity portfolios per policy
(mainstreamfirst stance).</p>
<p>C) Flows &amp; UX (keep it fast, clear, recoverable)</p>
<p>2minute ID flow target; progress meter; “Why you’re seeing this”
explainer tied to the trigger (e.g., “Needed to release payouts”).</p>
<p>Grace periods: If a trigger occurs midconversation, allow user to
finish current action and prompt verification before the next gated
action.</p>
<p>Failure recovery: clear reason category + retake guidance; escalate
to manual only after 2 failed attempts.</p>
<p>No hard walls at signup: users can browse, build profile/portfolio,
and message within free limits before any KYC.</p>
<p>D) Cost &amp; Monetization Posture (launch → scale)</p>
<p>Who pays (launch):</p>
<p>ID (Tier 1): Platformpaid (subsidized) in founding cities.</p>
<p>Background (Tier 2): Passthrough pricing; we may add a small coupon
to encourage early adoption.</p>
<p>Studio Lite (Tier 3): Platformpaid doc review for first 200
studios/city; then $19 docreview fee (waived by promo when needed).</p>
<p>Social OAuth: free.</p>
<p>Budget guardrails (Ops/Finance):</p>
<p>Set a monthly KYC budget cap per city (e.g., $750–$1,500),
autothrottle subsidies if exceeded (e.g., defer nonurgent Tier 1 until
payout trigger).</p>
<p>Track cost per verified and cost per incremental booking uplift; keep
CAC efficient.</p>
<p>Future levers (only postliquidity):</p>
<p>Optional expedited verification (24h fast lane) for a small fee.</p>
<p>Bundles (ID + BG) with modest margin only if conversion lift is
proven and churn impact is nil.</p>
<p>E) Automation &amp; Ops Model (devlight, scalable)</p>
<p>Vendors: one KYC SDK (ID + liveness), one BG vendor, geocode/Place
API for Studio Lite.</p>
<p>Manualexception queue: target &lt;10% of ID attempts; SLAs: ID &lt;
24h (exceptions), BG ≤ 48h (county delays may vary), Studio Lite &lt;
24h for failed automatches.</p>
<p>Staffing (pilot): 1 parttime reviewer per ~500–700 monthly
verifications (exceptions only).</p>
<p>Dashboards: pass/fail rates, exception volume, completion time,
dropoff at each step, cost per check, conversion lift vs.
unverified.</p>
<p>F) Data Handling &amp; Compliance</p>
<p>We store: status (Pass/Fail/Needs info), reason codes, timestamp,
vendor ID; no raw ID images/biometrics.</p>
<p>Retention: verification attestations 24 months or until account
deletion; honor legal holds.</p>
<p>Consent: explicit consent screens; link to privacy, biometric notices
where applicable.</p>
<p>FCRA/EEOC: preadverse + adverse action for BG denials; individualized
assessment; appeal path.</p>
<p>Nondiscrimination: no targeting by protected class; policy +
audits.</p>
<p>Marketplace role: verification conveys eligibility, not employment or
moral certification.</p>
<p>G) Studio Verification — MVP (what we do now vs later)</p>
<p>Do now (Lite): doc OCR + name/address match + geocode/Place check;
autoapprove if high confidence; manual on fails.</p>
<p>Don’t do now: inperson inspections, insurance validation, complex
KYB—defer to Phase 2 for highvolume venues.</p>
<p>Booking UX: buyers can select a Verified Studio from a list; private
addresses masked until confirm; location verification optional at
checkout for private addresses (“Verify general area”).</p>
<p>H) Incentives (make trust feel rewarding)</p>
<p>ID Verified: Instant Book + +20 DM credits; minor search tiebreak on
equal matches.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro: fee –0.5%, RFP priority, $15 Boost coupon (see §3.3),
badge on cards.</p>
<p>Studio Verified: filterable badge; “Studio” ribbon on cards;
inclusion in “Studios in [City]” carousel.</p>
<p>SocialVerified: perplatform chips and search filters; nightly trends
on profile.</p>
<p>I) KPIs &amp; Guardrails (first 90 days per city)</p>
<p>Adoption: ID ≥ 60% of active users; Trusted Pro ≥ 15% of active
providers; Studio Lite ≥ 10% of active studios.</p>
<p>Speed: median ID completion &lt; 2 min (selfserve); BG ≤ 48h (85%);
Studio Lite ≤ 24h (exceptions).</p>
<p>Conversion lift (vs. unverified): ID → +12–20% search→inquiry;
Trusted Pro → +10–15% inquiry→booking.</p>
<p>Dropoff: verificationstep abandonment &lt; 20%; if higher, simplify
flow or move trigger later.</p>
<p>Cost: monthly KYC spend within ±10% of budget cap; cost/verified flat
to down.</p>
<p>Kill switches: if search→inquiry or inquiry→booking drops &gt;10%
postgating in a cohort, relax triggers (e.g., gate at payout only) until
metrics recover.</p>
<p>J) Pricing (simple &amp; growthfriendly at launch)</p>
<p>ID Verification: $0 to user (platformpaid) in founding cities.</p>
<p>Background Check (Trusted Pro): passthrough (e.g., ~$25–$35 avg),
with promo coupon in first 60 days.</p>
<p>Studio Lite: $0 for first 200 per city; then $19 (doc review).</p>
<p>Social OAuth: $0.</p>
<p>Expedite (later): optional $9 fast lane if demanded
(postliquidity).</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.4 FINAL)</p>
<p>Milestonegated triggers wired (Instant Book, first payout, private
address, message caps).</p>
<p>Vendor integrations live (ID/liveness, BG, geocode), with
manualexception queue + SLAs.</p>
<p>Subsidy controls: percity KYC budget caps; throttle rules; ops
dashboards.</p>
<p>Attestationonly storage; consent &amp; privacy notices; FCRA/appeals
for BG.</p>
<p>Studio Lite OCR+geocode flow live; manual fallback; badge + search
filter.</p>
<p>Incentives: badges, fee nudge (Trusted Pro), DM boost, search
tiebreaks wired.</p>
<p>Metrics &amp; kill switches: adoption, speed, dropoff, conversion
lift, cost per verified; autorelax triggers if growth impact
detected.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Protects growth: No heavy checks at signup; verification happens when
users see the value (payouts, Instant Book).</p>
<p>Controls cost &amp; ops load: Automation handles most verifications;
platform pays for the musthave checks only; tight budget caps.</p>
<p>Builds trust fast: Visible badges and small ranking nudges reward
safe, reliable behavior and raise booking confidence.</p>
<p>Scales cleanly: Studio Lite now; deeper inspections only when
warranted. Citylevel dials let us tune friction and spend.</p>
<p>Notes for PM/Eng handoff: keep triggers and budgets configurable per
city; log all verification events for audit; run monthly reviews on
pass/fail rates, exception causes, and dropoff to continuously trim
friction without compromising safety.</p>
<p>§3.5 — Brand/Buyer Products (Briefs/RFPs, Shortlists, Concierge,
Delivery)</p>
<p>Goal: Buyers (brands, agencies, studios, solo creators) go from idea
→ shortlist → booked → delivered fast, with clear scope, documents,
storagesane delivery, and verifiable outcomes—without subscriptions.
Everything stays fair (relevancefirst), safe (escrow + esign), and
growthfriendly (usagebased RFP credits only).</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Speed with clarity: Briefs produce applestoapples quotes; awarding
triggers escrow, documents, and a Delivery Room automatically.</p>
<p>Relevance over volume: Invite the right providers; broadcast only to
eligible, verified cohorts.</p>
<p>Trustfirst: IDVerified/Trusted Pro gating, esign before checkin,
onplatform escrow &amp; dispute flows.</p>
<p>Storagesane delivery: Originals remain in buyer/provider cloud
(Drive/Dropbox/etc.); platform stores previews + manifests only.</p>
<p>Usagebased monetization: Smart Invite is free; RFP is creditsbased
(no monthly plans, no paywalls).</p>
<p>B) Buyer Personas &amp; JobstobeDone</p>
<p>Solo/SMB buyer: Needs a model/photographer for a simple shoot; wants
fast quotes and clear outcomes.</p>
<p>Marketing team/agency: Multiseat, needs shortlists, approvals, brand
docs, reporting.</p>
<p>Studio ops: Frequent, repeat bookings; prefers Verified Studios;
cares about schedule reliability.</p>
<p>Creator collab buyer: Seeks socialreach deliverables (IG/TT/YT posts)
with verification and postingwindow guarantees.</p>
<p>C) Brief Composer (Quick &amp; Full)</p>
<p>Required first step (Quick Brief = ~60s; Full Brief for complex
jobs):</p>
<p>Project basics: Role(s), city/radius, date(s)/time(s), duration.</p>
<p>Goal &amp; deliverables: Presets (e.g., “10 edited photos (3kpx), 2
vertical videos (1080×1920, ≤60s)”) + Influence presets (IG Collab,
Story Mentions, TT Post, YT Short) with posting window &amp; min
live.</p>
<p>Style refs: Moodboard upload/links; keywords.</p>
<p>Budget: Range or fixed; Budget sanity meter (compares to city/role
median).</p>
<p>Location: Pick Verified Studio or “Buyer provides address” (masked
until award); travel radius/fee toggle.</p>
<p>Eligibility &amp; safety: IDVerified/Trustedonly toggles, NDA toggle,
Nudity &amp; Boundaries (if models involved; artisticnudity only).</p>
<p>Model specifics (if applicable): Look filters + nudity tier +
chaperone policy + social metrics filters.</p>
<p>Timeline: response deadline, delivery date.</p>
<p>Docs preview: Shows the Smart Docs pack (SOW, License, Release, NDA
if toggled) that will autoattach on award.</p>
<p>Privacy: Hide brand name until award (toggle).</p>
<p>D) Smart Invite &amp; RFP Broadcast</p>
<p>Smart Invite (free):</p>
<p>System suggests 8–15 bestfit providers (role, availability, distance,
price fit, Rep Score, social metrics).</p>
<p>Buyer can edit and send invites (free). Providers get a consolidated
request thread with Quick Quote.</p>
<p>RFP Broadcast (creditsbased):</p>
<p>Sends the brief to a wider pool of eligible providers (IDVerified,
Rep ≥ 70, no safety flags).</p>
<p>Pricing: credit packs (e.g., 5 for $29).</p>
<p>Guardrails: min budget floors by city/role/duration; 1 live
broadcast/role per buyer; template checks to reduce spam/underpay.</p>
<p>E) Proposal &amp; Pricing UX (Provider)</p>
<p>Quick Quote (≈60s): select package, price, availability, short note;
optional addons (travel, extra edits, overtime).</p>
<p>Full Proposal: itemized deliverables (incl. social deliverables),
schedule/milestones, licensing line items, portfolio links.</p>
<p>No proposal peeking: providers don’t see others’ bids.</p>
<p>F) Compare &amp; Award (applestoapples + escrow)</p>
<p>Compare view: normalized grid: Price, What’s included, Rep Score,
Badges (ID/Trusted/Studio), Travel, Change/Overtime, Social posting
window, Notes.</p>
<p>Fit Score (0–100): assistive signal explaining match to brief (style,
budget, distance, availability).</p>
<p>Award flow: select winner → escrow deposit (default 50%,
configurable) → Smart Docs esign session opens → booking created.</p>
<p>G) Documents &amp; ESign (Smart Docs)</p>
<p>Autoattach pack on award: Service Agreement/SOW, License/Usage
Addendum, Model Release, Property/Studio Release (if needed), NDA (if
toggled), Safety Addendum (if Nudity Tier &gt; Lingerie).</p>
<p>Esign: draw/type with audit trail (IP, timestamp, device).</p>
<p>Gate: Checkin blocked until required docs are signed. Escrow won’t
release without docs + acceptance.</p>
<p>H) Delivery Room (storagesane delivery with verification)</p>
<p>Manifest = source of truth: Autogenerated from accepted quote
(counts/specs).</p>
<p>Storage model:</p>
<p>Previews on platform: webres photos &amp; 720p video proxies;
watermarks allowed for previews.</p>
<p>Originals external: Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive / Box / S3
presigned owned by provider.</p>
<p>Ingestion:</p>
<p>OAuth mode (preferred): pull file list/metadata → pin manifest
(names/sizes/MIME/URLs).</p>
<p>Linkonly mode: paste share URLs; we crawl to create a readonly
manifest.</p>
<p>Checksums: compute hashes for onplatform files; store length/etag for
externals; providers may paste SHA256 for finals.</p>
<p>Autochecks on upload: count, type/codec, pixel dimensions,
bitrate/duration, color profile, no watermarks on finals.</p>
<p>“All finals delivered” provider toggle validates against
manifest.</p>
<p>I) Acceptance, Revisions &amp; AutoAccept</p>
<p>Technical acceptance: once autochecks pass, Buyer Review window
opens.</p>
<p>Buyer Review: default 3 days (packageconfigurable) to accept, partial
accept (per milestone/group), or request inscope revisions (1 round
included).</p>
<p>Autoaccept: if buyer inactive after 3 days and autochecks passed,
system autoaccepts remaining deliverables; escrow releases per §1.3.</p>
<p>Change orders: outofscope requests routed to paid Change Order.</p>
<p>J) Influence/Promo Deliverables (verification &amp; enforcement)</p>
<p>Presets: IG Collab Post + Story Mentions; TikTok Post (+Duet/Stitch
optional); YouTube Short + Community Post.</p>
<p>Posting window &amp; minimum live: buyer sets (e.g., post within 72h,
remain live ≥7 days).</p>
<p>Verification:</p>
<p>If accounts linked via OAuth, system autoverifies URL and monitors
live status.</p>
<p>If not linked, provider submits the public URL; system captures a
snapshot &amp; status; buyer confirms.</p>
<p>Noncompliance: autoopens a deliverable dispute → 24h cure window →
partial refund equal to the allocated value if missed/removed.</p>
<p>K) Attendance, NoShows, Disputes (fast, evidencebased)</p>
<p>Checkin/out: both parties tap Start/End (geofenced, ±60 min).</p>
<p>Evidence log: timestamps, geotags, chat/call logs (durations),
manifests, behindthescenes snaps.</p>
<p>Buyer noshow / late cancel: refunds per policy (e.g., 72–24h = 50%
payout; &lt;24h = 100% payout).</p>
<p>Provider noshow: buyer 100% refund + goodwill credit; provider
reliability strike &amp; Instant Book pause.</p>
<p>Deliverables shortfall: 48h cure window; else partial refund
proportional to undelivered items.</p>
<p>Subjective disputes: one revision → Neutral Review (scopebased
outcome: reedit or partial refund).</p>
<p>Safety exception: fee waivers/credits as needed; safety review
autoopens.</p>
<p>L) Boards &amp; Collaboration</p>
<p>Boards: named shortlists with status tags (“New, Invited, Proposed,
Awarded”).</p>
<p>Teamwork: @mentions, comments, polls; readonly share link; optional
NDA gate for external reviewers.</p>
<p>Live freshness: cards show availability chips and price updates;
stale badge after 14 days.</p>
<p>M) Concierge</p>
<p>Concierge Light (free, automated): AI refines brief, suggests
scope/budget, drafts invites, schedules top 3 for 15min slots; nudges
for NDA and verifiedonly toggles.</p>
<p>Human Concierge (pilot; budgets ≥ $3k): coordinator curates talent,
wrangles schedules/deliverables; free at launch in founding cities;
later optional 2% success fee (postliquidity).</p>
<p>N) Permissions, Buyer Trust &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>Roles: Owner (billing/contracts), Editor (briefs/awards), Commenter
(notes/votes).</p>
<p>Payment Verified badge: once funding source on file.</p>
<p>Privacy: brand name masking until award; private addresses masked
until confirm; generalarea safety share during active booking only.</p>
<p>O) Safety &amp; Quality Controls</p>
<p>Eligibility gates: RFP to IDVerified (Trustedonly optional).</p>
<p>Budget floors: prevent unrealistic budgets; assist with suggested
ranges.</p>
<p>Offplatform detection: warnings &amp; throttles in chat.</p>
<p>NSFW guardrails: artisticnudity only; explicit content blocked;
nudity tiers &amp; safety addendum enforced.</p>
<p>Buyer reputation: Providers see Buyer Rep (ontime payment, dispute
rate, repeat bookings).</p>
<p>P) Pricing &amp; Credits (Launch)</p>
<p>Smart Invite: free.</p>
<p>RFP Broadcast credits: 5 for $29 (consumed per role/city
broadcast).</p>
<p>Foundingcity promo: 5 free RFP credits for new PaymentVerified buyers
+ 0% buyer fee on first booking.</p>
<p>Credit refunds: autocredit 1 if &lt;3 qualified responses by
deadline; full pack credit if 0 responses.</p>
<p>Q) Integrations &amp; Contracts</p>
<p>Escrow &amp; payouts: per §1.3 (milestones supported; partial
releases on partial accept).</p>
<p>Smart Docs: autoattached on award; esign gating before checkin;
PDFs/versioning in thread.</p>
<p>Calendar: ICS export; conflict checks vs provider availability.</p>
<p>Storage: external delivery required for large assets; platform stores
previews + manifests only (see §1.4).</p>
<p>Social OAuth: for autoverification of influence deliverables.</p>
<p>R) Analytics</p>
<p>Buyer dashboard: outreach→response, timetoaward, spend by project,
cost per deliverable, provider performance.</p>
<p>Platform: RFP adoption, response quality, award rate, GMV per brief,
credit refund rate, Instant Book vs RFP split, deliverable dispute
rates, autoaccept rate.</p>
<p>S) KPIs &amp; Targets (first 90 days/city)</p>
<p>Adoption: ≥ 35% of bookings originate via Smart Invite/RFP flows.</p>
<p>Speed: median brief → first qualified response ≤ 2 hours (business
hours); brief → award ≤ 48 hours for Quick Briefs.</p>
<p>Quality: ≥ 60% of broadcasts yield ≥3 qualified responses; provider
response rate ≥ 45%; buyer CSAT ≥ 4.5/5.</p>
<p>Trust: disputes/noshows at or below Instant Book baseline;
offplatform attempts in RFP threads &lt; 1%.</p>
<p>Economics: RFPsourced GMV ≥ 30% by month 6; credit refund rate &lt;
12%.</p>
<p>Delivery health: autoaccept ≥ 50% of jobs; deliverable disputes &lt;
5%; influence noncompliance &lt; 6%.</p>
<p>T) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.5 FINAL)</p>
<p>Brief Composer live (Quick &amp; Full) with budget guidance,
influence presets, nudity/boundaries step, and Smart Docs preview.</p>
<p>Smart Invite (free) &amp; RFP Broadcast (credits) live with
eligibility gates and budget floors.</p>
<p>Proposal UX (Quick Quote + Full) with addons, licensing, influence
deliverables.</p>
<p>Compare &amp; Award + escrow deposit + Smart Docs esign gating before
checkin.</p>
<p>Delivery Room with manifests, previews/proxies, external delivery
ingestion (OAuth + linkonly), autochecks, watermark detection,
autoaccept timer.</p>
<p>Influence verification (OAuth/URL snapshot) with posting window &amp;
minimumlive enforcement.</p>

refunds, Neutral Review); travel matrix referenced.</p>
<p>Boards &amp; collaboration, Concierge Light, and Human Concierge
pilot live.</p>
<p>Buyer roles &amp; privacy, Payment Verified badge, NSFW
guardrails.</p>
<p>Analytics dashboards shipping KPIs above.</p>
<p>U) Why this works</p>
<p>Clear scope → fewer disputes: Smart Docs + normalized quotes +
manifests make expectations explicit.</p>
<p>Storage costs contained: We host previews &amp; paperwork; originals
stay in Drive/Dropbox/etc. with verifiable manifests.</p>
<p>Faster to “yes”: Smart Invite + Quick Quotes + Fit Score reduce time
to award.</p>
<p>Verifiable outcomes: Autochecks, posting verification, and autoaccept
keep projects moving and payouts timely.</p>
<p>Fair &amp; safe: Relevancefirst ranking, verified cohorts, esign
gating, and escrow create trust without adding paywalls.</p>

<p>SubSection 3.6 — Seller Tools &amp; Workflows (Models • Photographers
• Videographers • Creators)</p>
<p>Goal: Give sellers a fast, repeatable workflow that turns profile
views into booked, wellscoped jobs—and makes delivery, disputes, and
payouts painless. Tools are roleaware, storagesane, and trustfirst.
Monetization remains usagebased (no subscriptions at launch).</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Publish in minutes, improve forever: ship an MVP service profile
quickly; refine with datadriven suggestions.</p>
<p>Roleaware, single account: one login, multiple service profiles
(Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator) with clean separation in
search and reviews.</p>
<p>Clarity prevents disputes: packages, Smart Docs, Delivery Room
manifests, and timeboxed review windows make outcomes objective.</p>
<p>Storagesane by default: previews on platform; originals remain in
seller’s cloud (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/Box/S3 links).</p>
<p>Trust earns advantages: verification &amp; reputation unlock Instant
Book, tiebreaks, Early Payout, RFP priority—never paytowin.</p>
<p>B) Seller Onboarding Wizard (10–12 minutes, roleaware)</p>
<p>Step 1 — Choose roles: Model / Photographer / Videographer / Creator
(can add more later).<br />
Step 2 — Portfolio basics: upload perrole cover image(s), 12–24
highlights; set Nudity Tier &amp; Comfort (Models/Creators).<br />
Step 3 — Packages (per role): pick package templates (below), add
price/duration/what’s included, turnaround time, revision policy,
overtime &amp; change rates.<br />
Step 4 — Addons: travel (matrix), extra looks/edits, rush delivery,
social posts, studio rental addon, hair/makeup partner, etc.<br />
Step 5 — Availability: weekly schedule blocks, Instant Book windows,
buffers, travel time logic; connect calendar (ICS).<br />
Step 6 — Location: base city, service radius, touring dates (for
traveling models/creators).<br />
Step 7 — Safety &amp; preferences: chaperone welcomed/required,
genderpref team (optional), boundaries.<br />
Step 8 — Pricing strategy: enable intro discount (first 3 bookings),
lastminute fill (autodiscount empty slots), minimum price
guardrail.<br />
Step 9 — Connect social: IG/YT/TT/X for verified chips &amp; search
filters (per §1.2 addendum).<br />
Step 10 — Verification prompts: ID (to unlock Instant Book), optionally
Background (Trusted Pro), Studio Lite (if applicable).<br />
Publish → profile QA checklist + “What improves ranking” tips (response
time, verified docs, price fit).</p>
<p>C) Package Templates &amp; AddOns (per role)</p>
<p>Templates are opinionated defaults sellers can edit—keeps quotes
comparable &amp; reduces scope creep.</p>
<p>Photographer</p>
<p>Starter Session (60–90 min): X looks, X edited photos (e.g., 10), raw
previews for selection, 7day delivery, 1 revision.</p>
<p>HalfDay / FullDay: timebased; includes lighting, basic studio
backdrop; deliverables by count (e.g., 25/50 edits).</p>

<p>D) Availability, Calendar &amp; Touring</p>
<p>Instant Book windows: sellers choose days/times eligible for IB;
buffers enforced; travel time autocalc by radius.</p>
<p>Blackouts &amp; holds: dragtoblock; softhold expires after X hours if
buyer doesn’t escrow.</p>
<p>Calendar sync: ICS oneway export; ICS imports supported
(Google/Apple/Outlook).</p>
<p>Touring calendar: add cities with date ranges; appears as “Visiting
[City]” chip in search; availability filters respect touring.</p>
<p>Reschedule &amp; edits (providerside): providers can propose
time/date changes, price adjustments, partial refunds—buyer must approve
inthread; Smart Docs autoamend and receipts reissue (per §1.4
addendum).</p>
<p>E) Inbox &amp; Lead Pipeline (built on §1.4 Messaging)</p>
<p>Pipeline states: New → Needs Info → Quoted → Awarded → Booked →
Delivered → Completed → Archived.</p>

preview.</p>
<p>Ratelimit &amp; DM credits: credits meter with +20 for ID Verified;
+20 for Trusted Pro (max 80 at launch, per §3.2).</p>
<p>Offplatform guardrails: gentle warnings &amp; throttles if
payment/handle sharing detected.</p>
<p>F) Pricing Intelligence &amp; Controls</p>
<p>City benchmark &amp; pricefit index: shows how package price compares
to city/role median; flag “too low/too high” risk.</p>
<p>Lastminute fill: toggle % discount for slots &lt;72h away to lift
utilization.</p>
<p>Intro discount: automatic for first 3 onplatform bookings.</p>
<p>Coupons: provider can generate singleuse or timeboxed codes (stacking
rules respect §3.1 fee floors).</p>

“Rush delivery – add $XX”) with singleclick change orders.</p>
<p>Travel matrix editor: zone/mileage tiers, permile or perzone;
autoquote at checkout; postevent Travel Adjustment workflow (evidence,
48h cure).</p>
<p>G) Smart Docs &amp; Policy Controls (sellerfriendly)</p>

orders, overtime, kill fees, licensing tiers (web/social/paid/term).</p>
<p>Preset packs by vertical (ecomm, editorial, music video, UGC).</p>
<p>Chaperone &amp; boundaries (models/creators): defaults propagate into
SOW &amp; Safety Addendum; booking brief enforces buyer
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>License calculator: price deltas for media types/geos/terms; add to
quote with one click.</p>
<p>H) Delivery &amp; Proofing (seller side)</p>

(Drive/Dropbox/etc.).</p>
<p>Autochecks: counts/specs/codec/pixel/bitrate; watermark detection on
finals.</p>
<p>Client proofing: contact sheet, star/flag, comments on preview
assets; lock on acceptance.</p>
<p>Revisions: one included round by default; subsequent rounds become

revision cycles avg ≤ 1.3.</p>
<p>Reputation: avg Rep Score ≥ 78 by day 60 for active cohort.</p>
<p>Economics: Early Payout usage 10–20% among eligible; boost ROAS (for
users who try it) ≥ 2.5×.</p>
<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.6 FINAL)</p>
<p>Onboarding wizard (roles, portfolio, packages, addons, availability,
location, safety, pricing, social, verification prompts).</p>
<p>Package templates &amp; Addons live per role; travel matrix editor;
overtime &amp; changeorder rules.</p>
<p>Availability with IB windows, buffers, calendar sync, touring
calendar; providerside reschedule/price edits with buyer approval &amp;
autoamend docs.</p>
<p>Inbox pipeline with states, Quick Replies, Quick Quote,
snooze/remind, autonudge, DMcredit meter &amp; guardrails.</p>
<p>Pricing intelligence (benchmarks, pricefit, intro &amp; lastminute
discounts, coupons).</p>
<p>Smart Docs library with esign; SOW/License/Release/Property/Safety
addenda autoattach; checkin gate.</p>
<p>Delivery Room with manifests, previews/proxies, externallink

preview upload, push nudges.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Less friction, more bookings: sellers launch fast, quote faster, and
close with clarity.</p>
<p>Fewer disputes: standardized packages + Smart Docs + Delivery Room
manifests turn “hesaid/shesaid” into objective checks.</p>
<p>Costs under control: originals stay in sellers’ cloud; we store only
previews + manifests; no surprise infra bills.</p>
<p>Trust compounds: verification and high Rep Score unlock advantages
that improve conversion and marketplace quality—without paywalls.</p>

<p>§3.7 — Reviews, Reputation &amp; Incentives</p>
<p>Goal: Capture highsignal, lowfriction feedback after every booking;
turn reliability and respect into visible trust; reward great behavior
with small but meaningful advantages—without creating paytowin or review
gaming.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Only from verified interactions. Reviews and references originate
only from completed onplatform bookings (or marked “Completed –
TFP/Collab”).</p>
<p>Doubleblind &amp; timeboxed. Both sides review; neither sees the
other’s until both submit or the window closes.</p>
<p>Roleaware &amp; fair. Reviews are per role
(Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription Creator);
search/rank use rolespecific scores.</p>
<p>Evidence over rhetoric. Objective signals (attendance, deliverable
manifests, timing) carry more weight than freetext opinions.</p>
<p>Positive incentives, not paywalls. Rewards for reliability and
verification; never for positive sentiment specifically.</p>
<p>B) When &amp; how reviews happen (flow)</p>
<p>Trigger: When a booking moves to Completed (acceptance or
autoaccept), both parties receive review prompts.</p>
<p>Window: 7 days to submit; if one party submits, the other has 7 days
from that moment; then publish simultaneously.</p>
<p>Noshow / cancelled: If a side is deemed NoShow or Provider/Buyer
Cancel – Late, the counterpart may leave a review; flagged with an Event
label (e.g., “Noshow”).</p>
<p>TFP/Collab: Reviews allowed; labeled “Collab (no cash)”.</p>
<p>Dispute coordination: If a dispute is open, the system delays
publication until resolution; reviews then publish with a Resolved
badge.</p>
<p>C) Review structure (roleaware rubric)</p>
<p>Star rating (overall): 1–5 stars (halfstars allowed).<br />
Subratings (1–5, shown on profiles; weight into Reputation Score):</p>
<p>For Providers (e.g., Photographers/Videographers/Creators/Models as
hired talent)</p>
<p>Professionalism &amp; Respect (onset conduct; comfort boundaries
honored).</p>
<p>Communication (pre/during/post).</p>
<p>Reliability (ontime, prepared; aligns with checkin/checkout).</p>
<p>Quality vs Scope (deliverables matched the agreed
brief/manifest).</p>
<p>Safety &amp; Comfort (Models/Creators) (for bookings with talent;
chaperone, privacy).</p>
<p>For Buyers/Brands (visible to providers)</p>
<p>Clarity of Brief (scope, references, decisions).</p>
<p>Communication.</p>
<p>Reliability &amp; Timeliness (arrived, stayed on schedule).</p>
<p>Respect &amp; Safety (professional set, boundaries honored).</p>
<p>Payments &amp; Approvals (escrow, acceptance, change orders handled
promptly).</p>
<p>Attachments (optional, storagesane):</p>
<p>Up to 3 preview images or short proxy clips (for context), or link to
public proof URL (e.g., verified promo post).</p>
<p>All attachments follow the artisticonly policy; no explicit
content.</p>
<p>Private feedback to platform (not public): single freetext box for
safety/moderation signals.</p>
<p>D) What displays on profiles &amp; search cards</p>
<p>Overall role rating (e.g., 4.8) + rating histogram + # of verified
reviews.</p>
<p>Recent highlights (last three reviews, 2line excerpts).</p>
<p>Badges &amp; signals: ID Verified, Trusted Pro, Studio Verified,
SocialVerified, FanSubscription Creator (18+ gated).</p>
<p>Operational stats (last 90 days):</p>
<p>Ontime rate (arrived/start on time), Completion rate (jobs finished),
Dispute rate, Response time (median).</p>
<p>Verified references counter: number of completed onplatform
collaborations.</p>
<p>For buyers: a Buyer Rep panel is shown to providers (see §H).</p>
<p>Search cards include: Rep Score ring, average rating, count,
last90day ontime %, and badges.</p>
<p>E) Reputation Score (0–100) — computation &amp; decay (refined)</p>
<p>Purpose: A quick, explainable trust signal; used in ranking as a
tiebreak (never overrides relevance/filters) and to gate certain
privileges (e.g., Boost eligibility, Instant Book).</p>
<p>Inputs &amp; weights (roleaware; timeweighted):</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; volume — 40%</p>
<p>Bayesianadjusted average of overall star ratings (per role) using a
Wilson score prior, with recency weighting (last 90 days ×1.5).</p>
<p>Reliability &amp; policy — 25%</p>
<p>Ontime start %, completion rate, noshow/cancel strikes (negative
weights with decay), doc compliance before checkin.</p>
<p>Responsiveness — 10%</p>
<p>Median first response time; reply rate to invites/RFP.</p>
<p>Verifications — 15%</p>
<p>ID (base), Trusted Pro (+), Studio Verified (+), SocialVerified (+
small).</p>
<p>Recent performance — 10%</p>
<p>Last 90day job NPS (“Would you book again?” Yes/No), dispute
outcomes.</p>
<p>Decay &amp; floors:</p>
<p>Strikes and poor events decay 25% per 90 days of clean activity.</p>
<p>New accounts show “New — building reputation” until ≥3 verified
reviews (prevents low initial scores).</p>
<p>Gaming protection:</p>
<p>Volume weighting cap: one job cannot change score by &gt;3 pts.</p>
<p>Reciprocal review detection: correlated 5star exchanges get
downweighted.</p>
<p>Anomaly flags: suspicious IP/device overlaps; cluster analysis for
ring behavior; autoaudit queue.</p>
<p>F) Incentives &amp; achievements (behavior shaping)</p>
<p>Universal (roleagnostic):</p>
<p>Complete your first 3 jobs on time → “OnTime Streak” badge + +10 DM
credits.</p>
<p>&lt;1hour median response for 30 days → “Fast Responder” badge +
search tiebreak +1 (only in equal matches).</p>
<p>Complete ID → Instant Book + +20 DM credits.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro → Provider fee –0.5%, RFP priority, $15 Boost coupon (per
§3.3).</p>
<p>Studio Verified → appears in studio filter; prioritized in “Studios
in [City]” carousels.</p>
<p>Rolespecific bonus nudges (examples):</p>
<p>Models/Creators: “Boundary Pro” (5 bookings with ‘Safety &amp;
Comfort’ ≥4.8) → profile highlight chip.</p>
<p>Photographers/Videographers: “Spec Perfect” (10 jobs with 100%
manifest pass, ≤1 revision) → small search nudge in equal ties.</p>
<p>FanSubscription Creators: “Promo Deliveries 10/10” (all posts
verified within window) → featured eligibility in “Reliable Promo”
carousel.</p>
<p>Review completion incentives (neutral):</p>
<p>Completing any review within window → +5 DM credits (regardless of
rating).</p>
<p>No incentives for positive ratings (to avoid bias).</p>
<p>G) Antigaming, moderation &amp; appeals</p>
<p>Content policy filters: NLP and rulebased filters for
hate/harassment/doxxing/explicit content; block or route to
moderation.</p>
<p>Defamation &amp; proof: Fact claims (e.g., “stole equipment”) must
include evidence (moderator can request); otherwise convert to opinion
phrasing or remove.</p>
<p>Extortion policy: Prohibit “change deliverables or I’ll leave 1★”;
report → fast moderation; outcomes: warning → strike → suspension.</p>
<p>Right of reply: Public owner reply allowed once per review; edit
window for typos 30 minutes postpublish.</p>
<p>Appeals: If review violates policy or is demonstrably false, removal
or redaction; SLA ≤5 business days.</p>
<p>Shadowweighting: Reviews from accounts with anomaly flags contribute
reduced weight without visible deletion (preserves transparency while
limiting harm).</p>
<p>Killswitch: If toxicity rate &gt; 0.8% of reviews in a 7day window,
tighten filters and increase human sampling.</p>
<p>H) Buyer/Brand Reputation (visible to providers)</p>
<p>Buyer Rep (0–100) components:</p>
<p>Payments &amp; approvals: escrow timely, acceptance within
window.</p>
<p>Reliability: ontime arrival/start, cancellation/noshow rate.</p>
<p>Respect &amp; Safety: subrating from providers; safety flags
(sealed).</p>
<p>Dispute rate &amp; outcomes.</p>
<p>Display to providers: Buyer Rep ring, recent labels (“Pays on time”,
“Clear briefs”), and counts (repeat rate).</p>
<p>Gates: RFP Broadcast requires IDVerified; poor Buyer Rep can trigger
manual review on broadcasts.</p>
<p>I) How Reviews &amp; Rep affect ranking &amp; access (guardrails)</p>
<p>Search ranking order: relevance → availability → distance → price fit
→ Rep tiebreak → minor nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).</p>
<p>Boost eligibility (per §3.3): Rep ≥75 and IDVerified; safety flags
disable paid delivery.</p>
<p>Instant Book gating: Rep &lt;70 or recent strike → IB disabled until
30 clean days or after remediation.</p>
<p>Visibility throttles: Repeated disputes/late cancels lower impression
share temporarily (gradual recovery with clean activity).</p>
<p>J) Notifications &amp; UX copy (snippets)</p>
<p>“Review ready”: “Your project with {Name} is complete—share how it
went (2 minutes). Your feedback publishes after both sides submit or in
7 days.”</p>
<p>“Keep it respectful”: “Reviews should be factual and professional. We
remove harassment, doxxing, or explicit content.”</p>
<p>“Appeal received”: “Thanks. Our team will review and respond within 5
business days. We may request evidence.”</p>
<p>“Streak earned”: “OnTime Streak unlocked: +10 DM credits and a
profile badge visible in search.”</p>
<p>K) KPIs &amp; targets (first 90 days / city)</p>
<p>Review completion rate: ≥70% (bothsided) within 7 days.</p>
<p>Median time to first review: ≤24h postcompletion.</p>
<p>Toxicity rate: ≤0.5% of reviews flagged; confirmed violations
≤0.2%.</p>
<p>Disputeadjusted bias: rating drift after disputes ≤0.3★
(fairness).</p>
<p>Correlation to outcomes: Rep Score topquartile → ≥20% higher
inquiry→booking vs baseline.</p>
<p>Appeals SLA: ≤5 business days average resolution.</p>
<p>Noshow reduction: repeat noshows drop ≥30% after streak/strike
logic.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance criteria (mark 3.7 FINAL)</p>
<p>Doubleblind reviews with 7day window, simultaneous publish, and
disputeaware delay.</p>
<p>Rolespecific subratings live; attachments limited to
previews/proxies; private feedback channel.</p>
<p>Profile displays: overall &amp; histogram, recent highlights, badges,
last90day ops stats, verified references.</p>
<p>Reputation Score computed per role with Bayesian/Wilson, recency
weighting, decay, and antigaming caps.</p>
<p>Buyer Rep visible to providers with components above; broadcast gates
enforced.</p>
<p>Incentives (streaks, fast responder, verification rewards) wired;
neutral reviewcompletion credits.</p>
<p>Moderation &amp; appeals tooling: filters, evidence requests,
redaction/removal, public reply, SLAs.</p>
<p>Ranking integration and feature gates (Boost eligibility, Instant
Book thresholds, impression throttles).</p>
<p>Analytics &amp; alerts for completion rate, toxicity, fairness,
anomaly/ring detection.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Trust you can see: Reviews are verified by bookings; objective ops
stats back up the story.</p>
<p>Fair to new users: Bayesian/Wilson and recency avoid “coldstart”
penalties and onereview whiplash.</p>
<p>Behavior improves: Streaks and small nudges reward what
matters—ontime, respectful, responsive, within scope.</p>
<p>Hard to game: Doubleblind, anomaly detection, and evidenceweighted
scoring blunt collusion and retaliation.</p>
<p>Brandsafe: Clear policy lines, 18+ gating for sensitive roles, and
fast moderation keep content and tone professional.</p>
<p>§3.8 — Growth Loops &amp; Retention</p>
<p>Goal: Turn first actions into habits and habits into repeat bookings.
Build crossside loops (buyers ↔︎ sellers), selfreinforcing trust loops
(verification → bookings → reviews → ranking), and content loops (feeds,
boards, case studies) — without paywalls and without harming
fairness.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Value → habit: Every loop must deliver immediate value (leads,
clarity, or time saved) within a user’s first 7–14 days.</p>
<p>Crossside by design: Features should create interactions that pull
the other side back (invites, tags, verified posts).</p>
<p>Trust amplifies growth: Verification, ontime behavior, and clean
delivery unlock visibility—not payment.</p>
<p>Polite, predictable comms: Fewer, better notifications with frequency
caps and onetap controls.</p>
<p>Roleaware, safe: One account, multiple roles; feeds and alerts
respect 18+ Safe Mode and artisticonly policy.</p>
<p>B) Lifecycle Model &amp; Health Metrics (how we decide what to
trigger)</p>
<p>Stages (per side):</p>
<p>New (days 0–7): Profile/brief created; hasn’t sent a quote (seller)
or award (buyer).</p>
<p>Activated (days 7–30): ≥1 meaningful action (seller: Quick Quote
sent; buyer: Smart Invite/RFP sent).</p>
<p>Habit (30–90): ≥2 completed bookings; reply median ≤ 2h; repeat rate
≥ 25%.</p>
<p>Risk: 14 days of inactivity and pending leads or saved searches.</p>
<p>Churn: 45 days no meaningful action.</p>
<p>Core health metrics:</p>
<p>Activation rate, time to first inquiry/quote/award, repeat bookings
%, time between bookings, saved search alerts → booking %, winback
%.</p>
<p>C) Core Loops (what pulls users back)</p>
<p>1) Supplyside loops (sellers:
Models/Photogs/Videographers/Creators)</p>
<p>Profile → Discovery → Lead → Quote → Booking → Review → Rank lift →
More Discovery</p>
<p>“Improve fit” hints on profile (pricefit index, missing ID, response
time) show impact estimate (“+12% more invites”).</p>
<p>Tagging loop: after each booking, both parties can tag each other in
1–3 portfolio items; tagged approvals add those posts to both profiles
and surface to each other’s followers.</p>
<p>Case study loop: postcompletion, onetap “Create case study” (cover +
3 images + 150 words). Case studies populate city/role showcases and
boost discovery.</p>
<p>Rebooking loop</p>
<p>Auto “Book again” button appears to the buyer 7/30/90 days after
certain packages (e.g., monthly content), prefilled with last scope +
adjusted dates.</p>
<p>2) Demandside loops (buyers/brands)</p>
<p>Saved Search → Alert → Smart Invite/RFP → Compare → Award → Favorite
→ Board revisit</p>
<p>Saved Searches with ANY/ALL filters (incl. social metrics, nudity
tiers, Verified/Trusted) send newmatch alerts (1/day max per
search).</p>
<p>Board updates: when a profiled provider updates availability, gains a
badge, or posts a relevant case study, boards with that provider show a
“Fresh” chip and optional digest.</p>
<p>Template briefs: last 3 briefs saved as templates; 1click Reopen
brief and Rebroadcast (consumes credits per §3.5).</p>
<p>3) Content loops (feeds &amp; follow)</p>
<p>Follow → Feed → Inquiry → Booking → Tag → Feed</p>
<p>Single unified feed per user with role tabs
(Model/Photog/Vid/Creator/FanSub Creator). Posting is once, tagged by
role(s); viewers filter by role.</p>
<p>Feed pulls: new case studies, availability cards (“Now booking
Saturday”), touring chips (“Visiting Austin 11/20–11/22”), Verified
Studio open slots, and Verified influence posts delivered (SFW preview +
“Verified” tick).</p>
<p>Safe Mode default keeps 18+ content hidden until toggled; feed
respects nudity tiers &amp; policy.</p>
<p>4) Social share loop (offplatform → onplatform)</p>
<p>Sharecard generator: onetap export of profile/case study as
socialready images (IG/TT) with QR + booking link.</p>
<p>Linkinbio minisite (autogenerated) shows packages, availability,
contact CTA; UTM tags attribute inbound traffic.</p>
<p>5) Verification loop (trust → visibility → bookings)</p>
<p>Completing ID unlocks Instant Book + DM credits → higher
inquiry→booking.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro (BG) grants fee nudge, RFP priority, Boost coupon → more
awards → more reviews → Rep Score up → ranking tiebreaks.</p>
<p>D) Retention Features (per user type)</p>
<p>Sellers</p>
<p>Lead Inbox nudges: “Reply within 2h to keep Fast Responder
badge.”</p>
<p>Utilization alerts: “You have 4 open IB slots this weekend; enable
LastMinute Fill for +18% leads.”</p>
<p>Smart “Raise price” hints when win rate &gt;70% and price well below
city median.</p>
<p>Touring assist: suggest nearby cities and dates based on follower
heatmap; autocreate “Visiting [City]” chip.</p>
<p>Buyers</p>
<p>Shortlist intelligence: “3 of your saved photogs now Instant Book
next Friday.”</p>
<p>Availability windows: “Top models in your board opened 8–10pm
Fri.”</p>
<p>Budget guardrails: recommendations to adjust range for ≥3 qualified
responses.</p>
<p>“Book again” reminders synced to last project cadence.</p>
<p>E) Referrals &amp; Credits (twosided, abuseresistant)</p>
<p>Provider invites provider: both get +20 DM credits after invitee
publishes a package and completes 1 booking.</p>
<p>Buyer invites buyer: inviter gets 1 RFP credit when invitee posts a
brief and awards a booking.</p>
<p>Crossside referrals: if a provider invites a buyer who books them,
both get $15 buyer credit toward next booking (used on buyer fee
only).</p>
<p>Guardrails: peruser monthly caps; ID required to redeem; same
device/IP fraud detection; clawback if first booking is refunded for
fraud.</p>
<p>F) Saved Searches, Alerts &amp; Digests</p>
<p>Saved search alerts: new matches batched 1/day/search; “turn off for
30 days” easy toggle.</p>
<p>Weekly city digest (optin): featured case studies, Verified Studios
with open slots, “Top rising creators” (Rep + recent growth).</p>
<p>Postbooking digest: 7 days after completion—review reminder, case
study prompt, “book again” CTA.</p>
<p>G) Follows, Favorites &amp; Boards (organization that retains)</p>
<p>Follow counts on profiles; Following tab shows only updates from
accounts you follow.</p>
<p>Favorites folders/Boards: draganddrop; status tags autoupdate
(Invited/Proposed/Awarded).</p>
<p>Share boards externally (readonly) with optional NDA gate; activity
pings when providers on a board go Verified or open IB slots.</p>
<p>H) Notifications &amp; Frequency Caps</p>
<p>Channels: inapp, email, push (optin), SMS (critical only).</p>
<p>Global caps: max 2 push/day, 3 email/week by default; digest merges
alerts.</p>
<p>User controls: pertopic toggles (Saved searches, Boards, Touring,
Case studies, Instant Book windows).</p>
<p>Quiet hours: localtime 10pm–8am (nonurgent push deferred).</p>
<p>Respect Safe Mode: 18+ gated content never appears in public emails;
only visible inapp with toggle ON.</p>
<p>I) WinBack &amp; Churn Save</p>
<p>Risk cohort (14 days idle): send “quick action” emails (“Publish 1
package template in 60s” / “Send 3 Smart Invites from your board”).</p>
<p>Churn cohort (45 days idle): offer $15 buyer credit or +20 DM credits
if they complete a booking within 14 days.</p>
<p>Exit survey on deactivation: reasons (price, low leads, complexity,
safety). Autocreate remedial tasks (e.g., “Enable ID to unlock IB”).</p>
<p>Pause mode: let users pause discovery (hide from search) without
deleting; set autoresume.</p>
<p>J) Feed &amp; Posting (roleaware, one post → many views)</p>
<p>One composer with role tags; viewers filter by role.</p>
<p>Post types: Case study, Availability card, Touring card, “Looking
for…” (LFM/LFP rolegated), Verified promo delivered (SFW preview).</p>
<p>Ranking: follows → samecity trending → recommended (Repweighted).</p>
<p>Moderation: AI + human; artisticonly policy; Safe Mode hides 18+
until toggled.</p>
<p>K) Experiments (first 8–12 weeks)</p>
<p>Saved search alert frequency: immediate vs daily batch.</p>
<p>“Book again” reminder timing: +14 vs +30 days.</p>
<p>Case study autoprompt: shown at acceptance vs at review
submission.</p>
<p>Referral reward mix: DM credits vs $ buyer credits impact on
bookings.</p>
<p>Feed ranking weights: followheavy vs citytrending weight.</p>
<p>Touring chip CTR: prominent vs subtle card.</p>
<p>L) KPIs &amp; Targets (90day per city)</p>
<p>Activation: sellers sending a first Quick Quote ≥ 55%; buyers sending
a first Smart Invite/RFP ≥ 60%.</p>
<p>Habit: ≥ 30% of activated users complete 2+ bookings in 60 days.</p>
<p>Repeat: ≥ 35% of bookings are repeat buyer↔︎provider pairings by month
6.</p>
<p>Saved searches: alert → click ≥ 18%; click → booking ≥ 6%.</p>
<p>Boards: ≥ 45% of active buyers maintain ≥1 board; board revisit rate
≥ 2×/month.</p>
<p>Referrals: ≥ 15% of new users join via invite; fraud rate on
referrals &lt; 1%.</p>
<p>Winback: ≥ 12% of risk cohort reactivated; ≥ 8% of churn cohort
return within 30 days.</p>
<p>Feed: poster → inbound inquiry uplift ≥ 10% vs nonposters; toxicity
&lt; 0.5%.</p>
<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.8 FINAL)</p>
<p>Saved searches with ANY/ALL logic (incl. social metrics and nudity
tiers), daily batched alerts, onetap unsubscribe.</p>
<p>Follows/Boards with status tags, external share links, and board
refresh “Fresh” chips.</p>
<p>Unified feed with role filters, Safe Mode gating,
availability/touring cards, case studies, verified promo posts.</p>
<p>Referral system (twosided) with caps, KYC gating, fraud checks, and
credit types (DM, RFP, buyer fee credit).</p>
<p>Rebooking buttons with prefilled scopes; brief templates and onetap
rebroadcasts.</p>
<p>Lead &amp; utilization nudges, pricefit hints, touring assist.</p>
<p>Comms controls &amp; caps (channels, quiet hours, Safe Mode email
policy).</p>
<p>Winback flows for risk/churn; pause mode; exit survey &amp;
remediation tasks.</p>
<p>Analytics: lifecycle stage dashboards, loop performance (saved search
→ booking, referral ROAS, feed → inquiry).</p>
<p>N) Why this works</p>
<p>Selfreinforcing: Each completed job seeds reviews, tags, case
studies, and “book again” triggers that bring both sides back.</p>
<p>Buyer clarity = speed: Saved searches, boards, and brief templates
shrink timetoaward.</p>
<p>Fair &amp; safe: Visibility comes from trust and performance; Safe
Mode protects brand and compliance.</p>
<p>Costefficient: Credits (DM/RFP/buyer fee) and smart nudges drive
retention without monthly paywalls.</p>
<p>§3.9 — Support, Refunds, Disputes &amp; Knowledge Base</p>
<p>Goal: Resolve issues quickly and fairly, protect users in urgent
situations, keep most cases selfserve, and preserve trust &amp; margins.
Make outcomes predictable (clear matrices), evidencebased (manifests,
checkin/out, verified posts), and brandsafe.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Selfserve first, human when needed. Most
changes/cancellations/refunds can be initiated inthread and settled
automatically under clear rules.</p>
<p>Evidence &gt; rhetoric. We rely on Delivery Room manifests,
autochecks, checkin/out, and Smart Docs to decide.</p>
<p>Timeboxed resolution. Cure windows and decision SLAs keep money and
media from lingering.</p>
<p>Safety has priority. P0 lifesafety routes to Safety team immediately;
fees are waived where appropriate.</p>
<p>Transparent playbook. The same refund matrix applies to everyone;
it’s visible in the KB.</p>
<p>B) Contact Channels &amp; Triage</p>
<p>Channels (launch):</p>
<p>Inthread “Get help” (contextual flows for that booking).</p>
<p>Account Help (global: billing, verification, policy).</p>
<p>Email/webform fallback.</p>
<p>Triage &amp; priority:</p>
<p>P0 — Safety/Emergency (live/just occurred): response target ≤ 5 min,
24/7 oncall.</p>
<p>P1 — Timecritical booking (&lt;24h): response ≤ 30 min during
coverage hours.</p>
<p>P2 — Active booking / delivery in progress: ≤ 4 h.</p>
<p>P3 — General/billing/policy: ≤ 1 business day.</p>
<p>Selfserve flows available from “Get help”:</p>
<p>Change date/time, add/remove addons, adjust travel, request refund,
report noshow, report safety issue, delivery problem, chargeback info,
verification help.</p>
<p>C) Refund &amp; Adjustment Matrix (default policy)</p>
<p>Packages can raise/lower strictness within allowed bands; stricter
terms must be surfaced at checkout and inside Smart Docs.</p>
<p>1) Cancellations &amp; NoShows</p>
<p>2) Delivery Shortfalls &amp; Quality</p>
<p>3) Influence/Promo Deliverables (IG/TT/YT/X)</p>
<p>4) Travel &amp; Location</p>
<p>Safety exception: If a party flags unsafe conduct (harassment, unsafe
set), we waive platform fees, refund appropriately, and open a Safety
case.</p>
<p>D) Dispute Process (structured &amp; fast)</p>
<p>Open from “Get help” → choose reason.</p>
<p>Collect evidence: system preattaches manifest, autochecks,
checkin/out, chat. Parties add statements &amp; files.</p>
<p>Cure window: provider gets 48h for technical shortfalls; buyer gets
24h to supply missing info (e.g., link URLs).</p>
<p>Neutral Review (if unresolved): trained specialists compare against
Smart Docs &amp; manifest; may request targeted files only (no
fishing).</p>
<p>Decision: prorata refunds, reedit orders, or uphold delivery.</p>
<p>Payouts adjust automatically; receipts reissued.</p>
<p>Appeal (facts or policy error only): ≤ 5 business days SLA.</p>
<p>E) Chargebacks &amp; Payments Ops</p>
<p>Prechargeback rescue: autopropose settlement to buyer if they
initiate dispute with their bank; surface evidence inapp.</p>
<p>Representment kit (if chargeback filed): signed SOW/release,
manifest, acceptance logs, checkin/out, comms timeline.</p>
<p>Fees: platform absorbs processor dispute fees unless clear abuse →
losing party may be charged a small dispute handling fee (see §3.1).</p>
<p>Risk dials: newprovider reserve; rolling reserves for highrisk
cohorts; Early Payout eligibility aligns with Rep ≥ 85 (see
§3.2/§3.1).</p>
<p>Thresholds: keep chargeback ratio &lt;0.8%; above that → cohort risk
review; instant IB disable for outliers.</p>
<p>F) Safety &amp; Content Policy Escalations</p>
<p>SIRT (Safety Incident Response Team): oncall; responds ≤ 5 min to P0;
preserves evidence; may freeze funds.</p>
<p>Interim measures: temporary Instant Book disable, ad/boost
suppression, search visibility throttle.</p>
<p>Enforcement: threestrike model; immediate suspension for severe
policy breaches (e.g., explicit sexual content, violence, doxxing).</p>
<p>Law enforcement: cooperate under valid legal requests; strict privacy
controls.</p>
<p>G) Knowledge Base (KB) &amp; InProduct Help</p>
<p>KB structure (public):</p>
<p>Booking &amp; Payments: escrow, milestones, payouts, fees, taxes.</p>
<p>Cancellations &amp; Refunds: matrices, examples, timelines.</p>
<p>Deliverables: Delivery Room, manifests, previews vs originals,
external storage (Drive/Dropbox), checksum tips.</p>
<p>Influence Deliverables: posting windows, OAuth linking, URL proof,
dispute examples.</p>
<p>Documents: Smart Docs packs, esign, minor/guardian, safety addendum,
licensing.</p>
<p>Verification: ID, Background (Trusted Pro), Studio Lite, Social.</p>
<p>Search &amp; Roles: nudity tiers, Safe Mode, FanSubscription Creator
policy.</p>
<p>Safety: onset guidelines, reporting, chaperone policy, what happens
after a report.</p>
<p>City promos &amp; credits: RFP credits, buyer credits, DM
credits.</p>
<p>Legal &amp; Privacy: data we store (attestations), retention,
appeals.</p>
<p>Inproduct help:</p>
<p>Tooltips for fee math, cancel windows, deliverable specs.</p>
<p>Inline checklists (e.g., “Pass autochecks: JPEG sRGB, 3000px+”).</p>
<p>“Why this decision?” link on outcomes.</p>
<p>H) Internal Tools (Agent Console)</p>
<p>Unified case view (thread + booking + payments + verification).</p>
<p>Oneclick outcomes: prorata refund %, reedit order, fee waivers.</p>
<p>Evidence viewer: manifests, checkin/out map, file autocheck results,
social verification logs.</p>
<p>Policy macros: cancellation matrix variants, safety scripts,
adverseaction (BG) templates.</p>
<p>Account controls: IB toggle, visibility throttle, boost suppress,
temporary hold.</p>
<p>Ledger safety: doubleentry adjustments; immutable audit log.</p>
<p>I) SLAs, Coverage &amp; Staffing</p>
<p>Coverage: Safety 24/7; general support 16×5 at launch (expand to 24×7
by city #3).</p>
<p>Response targets: P0 ≤ 5 min; P1 ≤ 30 min; P2 ≤ 4 h; P3 ≤ 1 biz
day.</p>
<p>Resolution targets: P1 ≤ 12 h; P2 ≤ 48 h; P3 ≤ 3 biz days.</p>
<p>Houston pilot staffing: 1 Safety lead (oncall rotation), 2–3
generalists (day/evening), parttime adjudicator for Neutral Reviews.</p>
<p>J) Metrics &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>CSAT: ≥ 4.6/5; FRT &amp; TTR on target per priority.</p>
<p>Autoresolution rate: ≥ 50% of cases resolved selfserve.</p>
<p>Refund leakage: within plan; buyer fee refunds only on provider
fault/safety.</p>
<p>Dispute reopen rate: &lt; 8%.</p>
<p>Chargeback ratio: &lt; 0.8%; representment win rate &gt; 55%.</p>
<p>Safety: P0 median ≤ 3 min, repeat offenders caught; policy violations
&lt; 0.3% of bookings.</p>
<p>Fairness: outcomes distribution consistent across roles/cities
(monitor for bias).</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 3.9 FINAL)</p>
<p>Selfserve flows live: date/time change, addons, travel adj, refund
request, noshow, delivery problem, safety report.</p>
<p>Refund engine implements matrices above, with autocure windows and
prorata calculations.</p>
<p>Dispute center inthread: evidence collection, timers, Neutral Review
workflow, decision &amp; receipts reissue.</p>
<p>Chargeback kit generator; reserves &amp; IB gating rules wired.</p>
<p>Safety pipeline: P0 hotline, IB/boost suppress toggles, evidence
preservation.</p>
<p>KB published; inline tips &amp; “Why this decision?” links live.</p>
<p>Agent console: macros, ledger adjustments, audit logs.</p>
<p>Analytics dashboards: CSAT, FRT/TTR, refund leakage, reopen,
chargeback, safety SLA.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Predictable &amp; fair: Users see the same rules we apply; most
outcomes are obvious from the matrix.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; scalable: Selfserve, timers, and autochecks keep humans
for edge cases.</p>
<p>Trustpreserving: Safety first, evidencedriven decisions, and fee
policies aligned with fault.</p>
<p>Marginaware: Buyer fee refunds only on provider fault; prorata logic
prevents overrefunds; chargeback playbooks contain losses.</p>
<p>Addendum — §3.9 Support, Refunds, Disputes &amp; Knowledge Base
(Studios) — FINAL</p>
<p>Scope: Minimal but required clarifications so §3.9 cleanly covers
Studio bookings and Linked Booking Groups (Talent + Studio in one
checkout), without changing previously approved talent policies.</p>
<p>A) SelfServe Flows (additions)</p>
<p>Add the following quick actions under Inthread ▸ Get help:</p>
<p>Studio ▸ Access issue (can’t enter / code not working)</p>
<p>Studio ▸ Damage claim (hostinitiated; requires photos &amp;
description)</p>
<p>Studio ▸ Postbooking adjustment (overtime / crewsize overage / rule
violation)</p>
<p>Linked Group ▸ Propose reschedule (sync both bookings)</p>
<p>Linked Group ▸ Split or cancel (show sidebyside outcomes per
policy)</p>
<p>B) Refund Matrices (references &amp; summary)</p>
<p>Talent cancellations &amp; disputes: unchanged (see main §3.9
matrix).</p>
<p>Studio cancellations: use the Studio matrix (default bands:
&gt;7d=100% refund; 7–48h=50%; &lt;48h/noshow=0%).</p>
<p>Linked Booking Groups (LBG): outcomes are computed per booking and
shown in one summary (e.g., “Talent: 50% refund • Studio: 0% refund”).
Support agents use the LBG outcome view when editing/issuing
refunds.</p>
<p>C) Evidence Sets (studiospecific)</p>
<p>For Studio disputes we prioritize the following system evidence
(autoattached where available):</p>
<p>Checkin/out timestamps + geofence pass/fail.</p>
<p>House Rules &amp; Property Release esign audit logs.</p>
<p>Access logs (door code release/time sent; if integrated).</p>
<p>Before/after photos (host; timestamped).</p>
<p>Overtime/overage indicators (End time vs booked End; crew count
notes).</p>
<p>Calendar state at booking time (to counter “doublebooked”
claims).</p>
<p>(For Talent deliverable disputes, continue using Delivery Room
manifests/autochecks as primary evidence.)</p>
<p>D) Standard Outcomes (studiospecific)</p>
<p>Access failure (host fault): buyer full refund of studio; waive buyer
fee for that booking; goodwill credit allowed.</p>
<p>Amenity misrepresentation: cure if feasible (e.g., provide blackout
curtains), else partial refund aligned to value impact; repeat issues →
host strike.</p>
<p>Overtime/crew overage/rule violations: process via Postbooking
adjustment; approve with clear evidence; refund if host lacks
evidence.</p>
<p>Damage claim: up to the deposit hold cap; see §H.</p>
<p>E) SLAs &amp; Timers (studiospecific)</p>
<p>Access issue (live) → P1 (≤ 30 min response; aim to resolve on the
spot).</p>
<p>Damage claim window: host must open ≤ 24h after checkout; buyer
response window 48h.</p>
<p>Adjustment window (overtime/overage): host opens ≤ 24h; buyer
response 48h.</p>
<p>Neutral Review (if contested): decision target ≤ 5 business days.</p>
<p>F) NoShow &amp; Early Exit (studio)</p>
<p>Buyer noshow: apply Studio matrix (often 0% refund); deposit is not
captured unless damage/violation claimed.</p>
<p>Early exit: no prorata refunds unless host agrees; overtime may still
apply if late start pushes past booked end.</p>
<p>G) Chargebacks (studio specifics)</p>
<p>Representment kit must include: checkin/out logs, rules/release
signatures, access log evidence, house rules, before/after photos, and
any approved adjustments.<br />
Deposit captures are separate charges; submit damage evidence with
capture receipt.</p>
<p>H) Deposit Holds &amp; Damage Claims (operational notes)</p>
<p>Authorize at checkout (or 24h prior, host setting); release
automatically 48h postcheckout if no claim.</p>
<p>On approved claim, capture partial/full up to cap; no platform fee on
captured amount (see §3.1 addendum).</p>
<p>Abuse guard: frequent denied claims reduce host visibility and may
remove deposit privileges.</p>
<p>I) Knowledge Base (new/updated articles)</p>
<p>Add/refresh articles:</p>
<p>Studios 101: rules, access, deposits, cleaning fees, Instant Book vs
approval.</p>
<p>Attach a Studio to your shoot: how the inflow picker works; what
“Linked Booking Group” means.</p>
<p>Damage deposits &amp; claims: timelines, evidence, how captures
work.</p>
<p>Overtime &amp; adjustments: what qualifies, how to dispute.</p>
<p>LBG refunds explained: examples showing different outcomes for Talent
vs Studio in one checkout.</p>
<p>All KB entries should link to corresponding policy matrices and
timers above.</p>
<p>J) Agent Console (microtooling)</p>
<p>LBG outcome view: sidebyside (Talent | Studio) with autocalc; one
click to apply both outcomes.</p>
<p>Deposit actions: authorize/void/capture with reason codes; evidence
viewer.</p>
<p>Templates: “Access failure (host remedy/credit)”, “Adjustment
approved/denied”, “Damage capture approved/denied”.</p>
<p>Sanctions: toggle IB off for studio; reduce visibility; flag host for
quality review.</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §3.9 addendum FINAL)</p>
<p>New selfserve actions appear for Studio &amp; LBG cases.</p>
<p>Studio matrix referenced &amp; enforced; LBG summary surfaces
perbooking outcomes.</p>
<p>Evidence packs autoattach for Studio disputes (checkin/out, rules,
access, photos).</p>
<p>Deposit lifecycle supported in Support tooling
(authorize/void/capture) with audit logs.</p>
<p>Timers &amp; SLAs implemented (24h/48h/5day) for
claims/adjustments/neutral review.</p>
<p>KB articles created/updated; links wired from help flows.</p>
<p>Agent console: LBG outcome view, deposit actions, message templates,
IB/visibility sanctions.</p>
<p>L) Why this is “tiny” but necessary</p>
<p>It reuses §3.9 structure—just adds Studiospecific buttons, timers,
and evidence.</p>
<p>It keeps group bookings easy to explain and adjudicate: two bookings,
one summary.</p>
<p>It ensures deposits don’t become support landmines (clear windows,
tools, and receipts).</p>
<p>Section 4 — Product Architecture &amp; Page Map</p>
<p>Goal: Define a coherent, scalable UX architecture that turns our
marketplace rules into screens and flows. Keep the system roleaware
(people vs places), cityaware, SafeModebydefault, and storagesane. Bake
in trust (verification ladder, reputation), fairness (no paytowin
ranking), and booking clarity (escrow, Smart Docs, Delivery Room).<br />
Studios launch as space listings (not roles): a subhub + AttachinFlow
(brief/checkout), with separate bookings and policies, tied by Linked
Booking Group when purchased with talent.</p>
<p>A) What Section 4 guarantees (scope &amp; outcomes)</p>
<p>Every jobtobedone has a page &amp; path. Search, profile/listing,
booking, delivery, review, dispute—no “dead ends.”</p>
<p>One account, many offerings. A user can operate multiple Service
Profiles (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSubscription
Creator) and optional Studio listings.</p>
<p>Clear separation of entity types. People (roles) vs Places (studios)
remain distinct in search, reviews, policies, and payouts.</p>
<p>Mobilefirst, desktopstrong. A tight 5icon mobile nav; desktop topbar
+ action shortcuts; both share the same mental model.</p>
<p>Performance, safety, and accessibility are global requirements, not
afterthoughts.</p>
<p>B) Core entities (objects the UX revolves around)</p>
<p>Account — one login; owns assets and settings.</p>
<p>Service Profile (Role) — personbased offering: Model / Photographer /
Videographer / Creator / FanSubscription Creator.</p>
<p>Studio Listing (Space) — placebased offering; can earn Verified
Studio (Lite).</p>
<p>Search Query — role selector + filters; saved search + alert
cadence.</p>
<p>Board — buyer’s collection of candidates (talent and studios) with
statuses.</p>
<p>Brief / RFP — buyer’s scope; generates invites/broadcasts.</p>
<p>Booking — Talent or Studio booking; each has escrow, policy,
timeline, documents.</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group (LBG) — bundle of a Talent booking + Studio
booking in one checkout; independent rules, synchronized time.</p>
<p>Thread — messaging with attachments, quotes, docs, decisions.</p>
<p>Smart Docs — SOW/License/Release/Property &amp; House Rules; esign;
autoamend.</p>
<p>Delivery — Delivery Room manifest, previews/proxies, external links,
acceptance window.</p>
<p>Verification — ID, Background (Trusted Pro), SocialVerified, Studio
Lite; badge ladder.</p>
<p>Reputation — 0–100 score per role; separate space reputation for
studios.</p>
<p>Promotion — optional paid boosts/featured (guardrailed).</p>
<p>Support Case — refund/dispute/safety workflow with evidence
packs.</p>
<p>C) Crosscutting UX principles (apply everywhere)</p>
<p>Safe Mode default ON: gates 18+ people roles &amp; feed; studios are
never 18+ gated (content must remain SFW).</p>
<p>Roleaware everywhere: Search, cards, reviews, analytics all show the
relevant role/space context.</p>
<p>AttachinFlow: When a shoot brief has a time &amp; city, suggest
compatible studios before checkout.</p>
<p>Evidencefirst resolution: manifests/checkin/out/autochecks &gt;
rhetoric.</p>
<p>Storagesane: previews on platform; originals via
Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3 links (captured as a manifest).</p>
<p>Accessibility (AA) &amp; performance budgets: keyboardable filters,
strong contrast, TTI &lt; 2.5s on 3G Fast, route codesplitting.</p>
<p>Cityaware: location chips, city selector, and saved searches all obey
the current city context.</p>
<p>D) Global flows (from first visit to review)</p>
<p>Discover → Home/Category/Case Studies → Search (role selector +
filters) → Profile/Listing card → Message or Instant Book.</p>
<p>Plan → Brief (Quick/Full) → smart invites/RFP → Compare &amp; Boards
→ Award.</p>
<p>Book → Checkout (escrow, docs) → (optional) Attach a Studio → Payment
→ confirmation.</p>
<p>Work → Thread (prep) → Checkin/out (time evidence) → Delivery Room →
Acceptance.</p>
<p>Close → Payout → Doubleblind Reviews → Reputation updates → Growth
loops (follow/favorite/feed/case study).</p>
<p>If needed → Refund/Dispute/Safety → outcome per matrix with
evidence.</p>
<p>E) Surface families (we’ll enumerate pages in §4.0)</p>
<p>Public</p>
<p>Landing, Category hubs (roles + Verified Studios (Lite) subhub),
Search, Profile (role), Studio Detail (space), Case Studies, Help
Center, Auth.</p>
<p>Buyer</p>
<p>Brief Composer (Quick/Full), Compare/Award, Boards, Threads/Messages,
Checkout, LBG Summary, Delivery (read), Smart Docs (read/sign), Buyer
Dashboard (spend, teams).</p>
<p>Seller (roles)</p>
<p>Onboarding wizard (per role), Packages/Addons, Portfolio/Tagging,
Availability/Calendar, Threads, Delivery (author), Smart Docs
(author/sign), Seller Dashboard (analytics, payouts).</p>
<p>Host (studios)</p>
<p>Create/Edit Studio listing (wizard), Studio Dashboard (calendar,
rules, bookings, deposits, claims), Verification Lite status.</p>
<p>Crosscutting</p>
<p>Notifications, Verification Center, Payments &amp; Tax, Settings
&amp; Privacy, Support/Dispute Center.</p>
<p>Admin (essentials)</p>
<p>Support console, Safety, Promotions config, Verification review.</p>
<p>F) Navigation model (the contract; full spec later in §4.1)</p>
<p>Desktop header: Logo • Browse (roles + Verified Studios (Lite)) •
Search • Boards/Packages (context) • Messages • Notifications • Create •
Safe Mode toggle • City • Account.</p>
<p>Mobile tab bar: Home • Search • Create • Messages • Profile.</p>
<p>Create adapts: Buyer (Brief), Seller (Package/Post), Host (Studio
Listing).</p>
<p>G) Ranking &amp; fairness contract</p>
<p>Result order = relevance → availability → distance → price fit → Rep
tiebreak → tiny nudges (Verified/Trusted/Studio).</p>
<p>Promotions never bypass filters; density caps (e.g., ≤2 in top 20)
and “Promoted” labels are mandatory.</p>
<p>Eligibility gates: IDVerified, Rep ≥ threshold; safety strikes
suppress IB and paid delivery.</p>
<p>H) Global system rules we won’t violate</p>
<p>Separate bookings &amp; ledgers for Talent vs Studio (even in one
checkout).</p>
<p>Pertype policies (refunds, deposits) applied independently; the UI
shows one LBG outcome summary to the user.</p>
<p>No forced subscriptions at launch; monetization is takerate +
optional boosts, verification addons, and peruse Early Payout.</p>
<p>I) Performance, privacy, and safety baselines</p>
<p>Perf: image lazyload, skeleton cards, background prefetch for next
route, defer OAuth SDKs until needed.</p>
<p>Privacy: exact addresses hidden until confirmation; studio
surveillance disclosures required; minors require guardian docs.</p>
<p>Safety: P0 hotline, checkin/out evidence, hazard toggles inject
Safety Addendum, instant IB/boost suppression during investigations.</p>
<p>J) Analytics &amp; observability (event families)</p>
<p>Nav &amp; search: nav.click, search.open, search.apply_filters,
saved_search.create/alert.open.</p>
<p>Discovery &amp; boards: board.add, compare.open, invite.send,
rfp.broadcast.</p>
<p>Bookings: booking.create.talent|studio, booking.group.linked/split,
checkout.complete.</p>
<p>Docs &amp; delivery: doc.esign, delivery.manifest_pinned,
delivery.accepted/auto_accept.</p>
<p>Reputation: review.submit, rep.update, strike.add/remove.</p>
<p>Studios: studio.create/publish/verify_lite,
studio.deposit.authorize/capture/release,
studio.adjustment.open/resolve.</p>
<p>Promotions: boost.purchase, featured.book.</p>
<p>Support: dispute.open/resolve, chargeback.open/represent.</p>
<p>All events include role_or_listing_type, city, and user cohort tags
for citybycity rollout measurement.</p>
<p>K) Risks &amp; mitigations (known issues, bakedin controls)</p>
<p>Scope creep with Studios → Mitigation: subhub + attachinflow only;
capped city inventory; clear KPIs/killswitch.</p>
<p>Policy confusion in LBG → Mitigation: separate booking lines,
sidebyside outcomes, pertype receipts.</p>
<p>Growth vs brand safety → Mitigation: Safe Mode default; artisticonly
policy; clear surveillance &amp; hazard disclosures.</p>
<p>Infra cost (media) → Mitigation: previews only; externallink
manifest; virus scan on previews; cap perthread size.</p>
<p>Fairness perception → Mitigation: transparent ranking rules; labeled
promotions; eligibility gates.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark Section 4 FINAL)</p>
<p>Entity model (Account, Service Profile, Studio Listing, Booking, LBG,
Thread, Smart Docs, Delivery, Verification, Reputation, Promotion,
Support Case) defined and referenced consistently.</p>
<p>Global flows (Discover → Plan → Book → Work → Close → Support)
documented with no missing steps.</p>
<p>Surface families enumerated (public/buyer/seller/host/cross/admin) to
drive the Page Map in §4.0.</p>
<p>Nav model defined (desktop/mobile) with Safe Mode and city context
always accessible.</p>
<p>Ranking &amp; fairness contract documented (relevance first;
promotions capped &amp; labeled).</p>
<p>Safety/privacy/perf baselines established (Safe Mode, address
privacy, hazard toggles, perf budgets).</p>
<p>Analytics event families declared (to wire telemetry from day
one).</p>
<p>Studios confirmed as space listings with subhub + AttachinFlow only
at launch; LBG contract in place.</p>
<p>Nongoals (full venue marketplace features) explicitly excluded from
launch scope.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Clarity → speed: Clean entities and flows make the UI obvious and the
marketplace predictable.</p>
<p>Scales by addition, not revision: New roles or more studio inventory
slot into the same model.</p>
<p>Trust is structural: Verification, Safe Mode, and separate booking
ledgers are baked into the architecture, not bolted on.</p>
<p>Launchable: We can ship citybycity with confidence and expand without
rewiring the product.</p>
<p>§4.0 — Page Map (HighLevel)</p>
<p>Contract: Every user task has a screen and a clear next step. Pages
are grouped by Public, Buyer, Seller (roles), Host (studios),
Crosscutting, and Admin. Each entry lists route pattern, owner, key
sections, and primary CTAs. Mobile uses the same routes; some
interactions open as drawers/modals.</p>
<p>A) Routing &amp; Guardrails (global)</p>
<p>Route shape: kebabcase; city context as query (?city=houston) or
chip; IDs as slugs.</p>

<p>J) Critical Empty States &amp; Skeletons</p>
<p>Search empty: show relaxfilters tips, nearby neighborhoods, role
switch.</p>
<p>Profile with no packages: onboarding card “Create your first
package.”</p>
<p>Studio with no slots: prompt to add schedule; hide IB until set.</p>
<p>Boards empty: prompt to add from search; suggest saved search.</p>
<p>Delivery Room empty: manifest placeholder; externallink guidance.</p>
<p>Support center empty: point to KB and mostused selfserve flows.</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §4.0 FINAL)</p>
<p>All pages above have defined routes, owners, key sections, and
primary CTAs.</p>
<p>Studios exist as: /studios hub, /studio/{slug} detail, Create/Edit,
Dashboard, and AttachinFlow drawer.</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group has a dedicated checkout summary and refund
outcome presentation.</p>
<p>Safe Mode is globally present; FanSubscription Creator routes are
gated; studios remain visible (SFW only).</p>
<p>Delivery Room, Smart Docs, and Support flows are reachable from
bookings.</p>
<p>Buyer, Seller, Host, and Admin surfaces cover onboarding → booking →
delivery → review → dispute without dead ends.</p>
<p>Modals/drawers defined for all timesensitive tasks (attach, quote,
reschedule, claims).</p>
<p>City ops &amp; promotions admin routes exist to tune CPC floors,
featured pricing, and city launch flags.</p>
<p>L) Why this Page Map works</p>
<p>Nothing missing: Every accepted feature from Sections 1–3 has a page,
a route, and a CTA.</p>
<p>People vs Places clarity: Service Profiles vs Studios are cleanly
separated yet connect via AttachinFlow.</p>
<p>Launchable &amp; scalable: Focuses on Houstonfirst while keeping the
IA ready for multicity expansion and future categories.</p>
<p>Trust &amp; safety are visible: Docs, deposits, checkin/out, and
dispute paths are firstclass—not hidden.</p>
<p>§4.1 — Global Information Architecture &amp; Navigation</p>
<p>Contract: Make it obvious where to go for any task. Keep People vs
Places distinct in IA, keep city &amp; Safe Mode always available, and
keep create actions contextual (buyer vs seller vs host). All navigation
choices must support the Houstonfirst rollout and scale to
multicity.</p>
<p>A) IA Overview (mental model &amp; global state)</p>
<p>Entities:</p>
<p>People (Service Profiles / roles): Model • Photographer •
Videographer • Creator • FanSubscription Creator</p>
<p>Places (Space listings): Studio (can be Verified Studio via Studio
Lite)</p>
<p>Global state persistent in nav: City (chip), Safe Mode (toggle), Auth
(account), Search entry.</p>
<p>Discover → Plan → Book → Work → Close → Support flows are reachable
from any context within ≤2 clicks/taps.</p>
<p>B) Desktop Navigation (top bar + browse)</p>
<p>Top bar (left → right)</p>
<p>Logo → Home (cityaware modules)</p>
<p>Browse (megamenu; hover/click)</p>
<p>People: Models • Photographers • Videographers • Creators •
FanSubscription Creators (18+)</p>
<p>Places: Verified Studios (Lite) (subhub; not a toplevel pillar)</p>
<p>By City: quick list (current city first)</p>
<p>Case Studies</p>
<p>Search (prominent) → opens Role/Listing selector + filters drawer</p>
<p>Context area (autoswitches by user type and current route)</p>
<p>Buyer context: Boards</p>
<p>Seller context: Packages</p>
<p>Host context: Studios (quick link to studio dashboard)</p>
<p>If multirole: a small dropdown to switch the context link (Boards |
Packages | Studios)</p>
<p>Messages (badge)</p>
<p>Notifications (bell; grouped)</p>
<p>Create (primary CTA dropdown; contextaware)</p>
<p>Buyer: New Brief (Quick) • New Brief (Full)</p>
<p>Seller: New Package • New Post (case study/availability)</p>
<p>Host: New Studio Listing</p>
<p>Safe Mode toggle (default ON; age confirm required to OFF)</p>
<p>City selector (Houston default; typeahead)</p>
<p>Account menu</p>
<p>Profile switcher (tabs: Model, Photographer, Videographer, Creator,
FanSub Creator, Studio host)</p>
<p>Buyer Dashboard • Seller Dashboard • Studio Dashboard</p>
<p>Verification Center • Payments &amp; Tax • Settings • Help • Sign
out</p>
<p>Header behavior</p>
<p>Sticky on scroll; Search and Create remain visible.</p>
<p>When viewing saved searches/boards, a context bar under the header
shows chips for active filters and provides Save / Edit controls.</p>
<p>C) Mobile Navigation (tab bar + overflow)</p>
<p>Bottom tab bar (5 items)</p>
<p>Home (cityaware feed + modules)</p>
<p>Search (role selector + filters drawer)</p>
<p>Create (FAB; buyer/seller/host contextual)</p>
<p>Messages</p>
<p>Profile (owner view w/ role switcher tabs at the top)</p>
<p>Header controls (mobile)</p>
<p>City chip left; Safe Mode shield icon right (tap → age confirm +
toggle).</p>
<p>Overflow (⋯) menu: Boards, Notifications, Verification, Payments,
Settings, Help.</p>
<p>Sticky action bars</p>
<p>On Profile/Studio detail: sticky Book/Request bar.</p>
<p>On Search: sticky Filters / Save bar.</p>
<p>On Checkout: sticky Pay &amp; Confirm bar.</p>
<p>D) Search Entry Pattern (everywhere consistent)</p>
<p>Clicking/tapping Search opens a compact selector with six tabs:<br />
Model | Photographer | Videographer | Creator | FanSub Creator |
Studio</p>
<p>Tabs = People (first five) and Places (Studio) — visually separated
with a divider label.</p>
<p>Filters drawer (right on desktop; fullscreen on mobile) includes:</p>
<p>Common: city/radius, availability window, budget/price, distance,
minimum Rep, Verified/Trusted toggles.</p>
<p>Rolespecific (People): look &amp; comfort (models/creators),
specialties &amp; deliverables (photographers/videographers), promo
posting windows (FanSub Creators), perplatform social metrics
(IG/YT/TT/X).</p>
<p>Studio (Places): price/hr, min hours, capacity, creative amenities
(natural light, cyc wall, blackout, ceiling height, loadin/parking,
makeup/dressing room, grip/lighting, etc.), Instant Book, Verified
Studio toggles.</p>
<p>Saved Search: clearly visible Save button with cadence control (daily
batch); confirm sheet explains alerts &amp; Safe Mode behavior.</p>
<p>AttachinFlow pill: when a People search includes date/time, show
“Attach a Studio” pill above results; opens a prefiltered Studio
drawer.</p>
<p>E) Context Switching &amp; Role/Host Awareness</p>
<p>Profile switcher (Account menu on desktop; top segmented control on
mobile Profile) lists all enabled roles and Studio host if the account
has at least one studio listing.</p>
<p>Context link in the header (Boards | Packages | Studios)
automatically reflects the most relevant workspace for the current
route; quick dropdown to change it.</p>
<p>Create menu always matches the current persona: posting a brief
(buyer), creating a package/post (seller), or adding a studio
(host).</p>
<p>F) Where key actions live (global “where do I…?” map)</p>
<p>View &amp; edit my offerings (People): Account ▸ Seller Dashboard ▸
Packages/Portfolio/Calendar.</p>
<p>Create a studio listing (Places): Create ▸ New Studio Listing →
wizard; manage via Studio Dashboard.</p>
<p>Post a brief (buyers): Create ▸ New Brief (Quick/Full); invite or
broadcast from the brief.</p>
<p>Attach a studio to a shoot: From Brief or Talent Checkout, tap Attach
a Studio (drawer) → returns a Linked Booking Group summary.</p>
<p>Find inspiration: Browse ▸ Case Studies; deep link to People &amp;
Places.</p>
<p>Get help: Thread ▸ Get help (contextual flows) or Help Center.</p>
<p>G) Safe Mode &amp; Gating (global)</p>
<p>Default ON for guests and new users.</p>
<p>People: FanSubscription Creator and profiles with nudity tiers beyond
“Lingerie/Swim” are hidden when Safe Mode is ON.</p>
<p>Places (Studios): never gated by Safe Mode (studio media must remain
SFW).</p>
<p>Emails/push: never include 18+ previews; 18+ content visible inapp
only with Safe Mode OFF.</p>
<p>H) CrossLinks &amp; Shortcuts (reduce path length)</p>
<p>Profile → Invite opens Smart Invite prefilled with role, city, date
window.</p>
<p>Talent profile with linked studio shows “Owns/Has Studio” chip → deep
link to the Studio detail.</p>
<p>Studio detail shows Host card → deep link to host’s People
profile(s).</p>
<p>Boards cards expose Compare, Invite, Attach Studio, Book
shortcuts.</p>
<p>Case Study tiles link to both the talent and any tagged studio.</p>
<p>I) Header Context Bar (chips below header)</p>
<p>Appears on Search, Saved Search, Boards, Brief, Compare.</p>
<p>Shows active filter chips, city/date/time chips, and Saved state;
inline Edit and Clear actions.</p>
<p>On Linked Booking Group checkout, shows a twochip summary: Talent |
Studio (tap to expand each).</p>
<p>J) Error States &amp; Auth Walls (consistent pattern)</p>
<p>Authrequired actions (book, message, create) route through /auth with
a return URL; copy explains benefits and Safe Mode.</p>
<p>404 gracefully links to Search by role with city preselected.</p>
<p>403 uses policy copy (e.g., 18+ gating, suspended features); provides
Help link.</p>
<p>K) Accessibility, Localization &amp; Performance (global
baselines)</p>
<p>AA: keyboard navigable menus &amp; drawers; ARIA on tabs/filters;
obvious focus states; colorcontrast linting in CI.</p>
<p>Localization: strings via i18n; USEnglish at launch; localeaware
currency/date.</p>
<p>Performance: routebased code splitting; image lazyload; deferral of
OAuth SDKs until needed; search TTI &lt; 2.5s on 3G Fast.</p>
<p>L) Telemetry (navigation &amp; IA events)</p>
<p>nav.click (item, location), browse.open (section), search.open
(tab=role|studio), filters.open/apply, saved_search.create/toggle,<br />
context.switch (Boards|Packages|Studios), create.open
(brief|package|studio), safe_mode.toggle, city.change,<br />
attach_studio.open/select, lbg.checkout.open,
header_context_chip.click.</p>
<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.1 FINAL)</p>
<p>Desktop header implements Browse, Search, Context link
(Boards/Packages/Studios), Messages, Notifications, Create, Safe Mode,
City, Account with Profile switcher.</p>
<p>Mobile tab bar implements Home, Search, Create, Messages, Profile;
overflow contains Boards, Notifications, Verification, Payments,
Settings, Help.</p>
<p>Role/Listing selector in Search includes
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
People vs Places divider; filters drawers reflect rolespecific vs
studiospecific fields.</p>
<p>Attach a Studio pill appears only when a People search has date/time;
opens a prefiltered Studio drawer; selected studio persists to Linked
Booking Group checkout.</p>
<p>Safe Mode default ON; hides FanSub Creator and nuditybeyondLingerie
for People; does not hide Studios; email/push remain 18+safe.</p>
<p>Context switching works: Profile switcher (roles + host), header
context link (Boards/Packages/Studios), Create menu adapts to
persona.</p>
<p>Crosslinks: People↔︎Studio chips; Invite from profile; Board
shortcuts; Case Study deep links.</p>
<p>Header context bar shows active chips and supports Save/Edit/Clear;
LBG shows twochip summary.</p>
<p>Auth walls and error states follow the documented patterns;
accessibility, i18n, and performance budgets enforced.</p>
<p>All telemetry events above are emitted for
nav/search/safemode/create/context interactions.</p>
<p>N) Why this IA works</p>
<p>People vs Places clarity: Users always know whether they’re looking
at a person or a space, yet can combine them fluidly via
AttachinFlow.</p>
<p>Contextual creation: The Create menu and the context link reduce
cognitive load for multirole/host users.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; brand protection: Safe Mode is omnipresent and
conservative by default; studios stay visible but SFW.</p>
<p>Scalable: Adds cities, roles, or more studio inventory without
changing the mental model.</p>
<p>Fast paths: Crosslinks and sticky action bars trim steps from
discovery to booking.</p>
<p>§4.2 — Global Components &amp; Design System</p>
<p>Goal: Ship a coherent, performant, accessible component library that
makes every flow in §4.0/§4.1 consistent and fast to build. Components
are role/spaceaware, SafeModeaware, cityaware, and optimized for
mobilefirst. Everything here is implementationagnostic (works whether
you use React/Vue/etc.).</p>
<p>A) Design Foundations (tokens)</p>
<p>Color (semantic):</p>
<p>Primary (actions): --primary-600, hover -700, focus ring -300</p>
<p>Neutral (text/ui): --neutral-900/700/500/300/100</p>
<p>Accent (info): --info-600</p>
<p>Success: --success-600</p>
<p>Warning: --warning-600</p>
<p>Danger: --danger-600</p>
<p>Verification (badges): --verify-600</p>
<p>Promoted (labels): --promo-600 (used only for the “Promoted”
chip)</p>
<p>Type ramp:</p>
<p>Display, H1–H6, Body L/M/S, Caption, Mono (numbers). Use rem with
1.6–1.8 lineheight for body.</p>
<p>Numerals: tabular for prices, ratings, reputation rings.</p>
<p>Spacing &amp; radii:</p>
<p>Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40</p>
<p>Radius scale: 4, 8, 12 (cards/buttons), 999 (pills/chips)</p>
<p>Elevation: Card (1), Popover (2), Drawer (3), Modal (4)</p>
<p>Breakpoints:</p>
<p>XS &lt;480, SM &lt;768, MD &lt;1024, LG &lt;1440, XL ≥1440</p>
<p>Motion (reducemotion friendly):</p>
<p>Duration: 120–200ms (hover), 200–300ms (modals/drawers)</p>
<p>Easing: standard cubicbezier; respect prefersreducedmotion.</p>
<p>Icons (consistent set):</p>
<p>Roles (Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub), Studio,
Instant Book (⚡), Verified (✔︎), Trusted Pro (shield), Safe Mode
(shield18), Social (IG/YT/TT/X), Amenities (sun, cyc, blackout, height,
parking, makeup, grip, sound), Hazards (strobe, haze, flame,
ladder).</p>
<p>B) Layout Patterns</p>
<p>Page shell: Sticky header; 12column grid at MD+; single column at SM.

<p>D) Content &amp; Microcopy Guidelines</p>
<p>People vs Places: always say “Studio” for spaces; never “venue” at
launch.</p>
<p>Badges: keep labels short: “Verified”, “Trusted Pro”, “Verified
Studio”, “Instant Book”, “Promoted”.</p>
<p>Policies: use plain language (“Cancel by 7 days for full
refund”).</p>
<p>Safety: avoid alarmist tones; be clear (“House rules apply; cameras
must be disclosed”).</p>
<p>Email/push: never show 18+ previews; SFW copy only.</p>
<p>E) Accessibility &amp; Error Patterns</p>
<p>AA Contrast for all text &amp; icons; verify with tooling in CI.</p>
<p>Keyboard &amp; Screen Readers: focus trap in modals, labeled inputs,
ARIA on tabs/drawers, logical heading order.</p>
<p>Hit targets: 44×44 px minimum.</p>
<p>Errors: inline + summary; link to KB where relevant; keep technical
jargon out of user copy.</p>
<p>F) Performance &amp; Media Guidelines</p>
<p>Images: lazyload, responsive srcset, WebP/AVIF where supported; max
card image ~120–200KB.</p>
<p>Video: autogenerate lightweight proxies (muted, no autoplay on
mobile); never embed heavy originals.</p>
<p>Icons: sprite or treeshaken; defer OAuth SDKs until user opens Social
Connect.</p>
<p>Skeletons: render within 100ms to reduce perceived latency.</p>
<p>G) Telemetry (componentlevel events)</p>
<p>card.click (type=person|studio, promoted=true|false)</p>
<p>chip.click (type=verified|trusted|studio|instantbook|social)</p>
<p>filters.open/apply/reset, saved_search.create/toggle</p>

<p>H) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.2 FINAL)</p>
<p>Foundations (tokens, type, spacing, breakpoints, motion) defined and
consumable.</p>
<p>Core components delivered: PersonCard, StudioCard, BoardCard,
CaseStudyCard, SkeletonCard.</p>
<p>Chips &amp; badges for Verified, Trusted Pro, Verified Studio,
Instant Book, Social metrics, Promoted.</p>
<p>Search patterns: SearchBar, FilterDrawer (people + studio), Saved
Search, ANY/ALL social logic, Verifiedonly toggle.</p>
<p>Modals/Drawers implemented: Quick Brief, Attach a Studio, Quick
Quote, Change Order, PostBooking Adjustment, Damage Claim, Reschedule,
Review Composer, Safe Mode Toggle, Payment Method, OAuth Connect.</p>
<p>Delivery Room &amp; Smart Docs components complete and reused in all
flows.</p>
<p>Reputation &amp; Reviews components wired to ranking tiebreaks and
profile displays.</p>
<p>Verification Center components (ID, BG, Social, Studio Lite) with
unlock blurbs.</p>
<p>Calendars, Checkout, Notifications/Toasts, Admin split views ready;
deposit actions supported.</p>
<p>Accessibility (AA) &amp; performance budgets enforced; telemetry
events instrumented.</p>
<p>I) Why this works</p>
<p>Consistency → speed: One library powers all surfaces—less time
prototyping, more time validating.</p>
<p>Clarity of types: People vs Places appear distinct (but
complementary) across cards, filters, and checkout.</p>
<p>Safety &amp; fairness are visible: Badges, verified chips, Promoted
labels, and policy snippets make trust legible and ads honest.</p>
<p>Mobilefirst: Drawers, sticky bars, and concise cards keep flows fast
on phones.</p>
<p>§4.3 — Auth &amp; Onboarding Flows</p>
<p>Goal: Move new users from “curious” → first meaningful action fast,
with minimal friction and role/space awareness. Keep Safe Mode ON by
default, defer heavier checks (ID, Background, Studio Lite) until they
unlock value (Instant Book, badges, DM credits), and support multirole +
studio under one account.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Fast path first: Light signin, ask current city, and immediately
route to a next action (Search, Quick Brief, Quick Package, or New
Studio).</p>
<p>One account → many offerings: Users can create Service Profiles
(roles) and Studio Listings (spaces) under a single login.</p>
<p>Progressive verification: Verification is optional at first, but
clearly rewards users (Instant Book, DM credit boosts, badges, Early
Payout eligibility).</p>
<p>Safe by default: Safe Mode ON; FanSubscription Creator is agegated;
minors operate via guardian/agency (Phase 2).</p>
<p>Save &amp; resume: All wizards autosave; deep links return to the
exact step.</p>
<p>Measure activation: Instrument “timetofirst”: Saved Search / Quick
Brief / Package publish / Studio publish.</p>
<p>B) Auth (signup / signin)</p>
<p>Entry points</p>
<p>Header Sign in / Create account, plus intercepts on Book, Message,
Create actions.</p>
<p>Deep links preserve return URL.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Email passcode / magic link</p>
<p>Apple (native/app + web)</p>
<p>Google (web)</p>
<p>Phone SMS (optional; recommended for providers/hosts to unlock extra
DM credits)</p>
<p>First capture (all users)</p>
<p>Display name (public alias allowed; legal name later for payouts)</p>
<p>City (typeahead; defaults from IP) &amp; Timezone</p>
<p>Safe Mode = ON (explain; can toggle later)</p>
<p>Intent chips (choose any; sets next route):</p>
<p>Book talent / studios (buyer path)</p>
<p>List my services (seller path)</p>
<p>List my studio (host path)</p>
<p>Age &amp; policy gates</p>
<p>To create a FanSubscription Creator profile or toggle Safe Mode OFF,
user confirms 18+ (timestamped).</p>
<p>Launch policy: Accounts are 18+; minors only via
guardian/agencymanaged accounts (Phase 2). Studio media must be SFW.</p>
<p>C) Buyer Onboarding (Bookers/Brands)</p>
<p>1) Welcome choices (one tap):</p>
<p>Start a Quick Brief (30–60s)</p>
<p>Search now (roleselector preset to current city)</p>
<p>Save a Search template (e.g., “Models in Houston this weekend”)</p>
<p>2) Quick Brief (drawer):</p>
<p>Role, city, date/time, budget, deliverables, Attach Studio toggle</p>
<p>Send Smart Invites (top matches) or Broadcast RFP (credits)</p>
<p>Creates a Buyer Dashboard tile for the brief</p>
<p>3) Saved Search helper:</p>
<p>Offer 2–3 presets by role; daily alerts ON by default (user can
adjust cadence)</p>
<p>Buyer activation (success state):</p>
<p>Completed Quick Brief or saved first search or sent ≥1 Smart
Invite.</p>
<p>D) Seller Onboarding (Service Profiles: Model / Photographer /
Videographer / Creator / FanSub Creator)</p>
<p>Entry: “List my services” → Role picker (multiselect allowed; wizard
runs per role)</p>

promo”)</p>
<p>Set price, addons, licensing tiers, travel fee logic (radius +
permile or zone)</p>
<p>Instant Book toggle (locked until ID verified; show what it
unlocks)</p>

<p>Postpublish checklist (host)</p>
<p>✅ Add availability slots</p>
<p>🔓 Pass Studio Lite (shows Verified Studio badge; IB guardrail if
required)</p>
<p>➕ Link to your People profile (if applicable)</p>
<p>➕ Create a case study featuring the space</p>
<p>Host activation:</p>
<p>Published studio or accepted first booking.</p>
<p>F) MultiRole &amp; Linking Flows</p>
<p>Add another role: After finishing one, prompt to add others (e.g.,
model who also shoots).</p>
<p>Link a studio: From a People profile, Link Studio → select owned
Studio → profile shows “Has Studio” chip; Studio detail shows Host card
linking back.</p>
<p>Context switch: Profile switcher in Account menu (desktop) /
segmented control on Profile (mobile).</p>
<p>G) Verification Center (progressive, valuetied)</p>
<p>ID Verification → unlock Instant Book (people) + +20 DM credits</p>
<p>Background Check (Trusted Pro) → badge + +20 DM credits (people)</p>

requires</p>
<p>Early Payout eligibility (peruse fee) → for highrep accounts (Rep ≥
85)</p>
<p>UX: Each step shows “What you unlock”, typical duration, and success
rates.</p>
<p>H) Safe Mode &amp; FanSubscription Creator Gating</p>
<p>Safe Mode toggle in header during onboarding (explain what’s hidden);
default ON.</p>
<p>To create FanSubscription Creator: confirm 18+ and accept policy;
public media SFW; promo deliverables respect minlive rules (see
§3.5).</p>
<p>I) FirstRun Experiences (nudges)</p>
<p>Seller</p>
<p>“Get your first 5 leads”: Save a search for buyers, post a case
study, enable IB, connect social, set touring dates.</p>
<p>Pricefit hints vs city median; responsetime hint.</p>

Studio Lite, upload day/night light examples.</p>
<p>Buyer</p>
<p>“Speed up booking”: save searches, reuse briefs, attach a studio in
checkout, invite shortlisted talent.</p>
<p>J) Edge Cases &amp; Safeguards</p>
<p>Abandoned wizards autosave and email/push resume links.</p>
<p>Duplicate detection (People/Studios): softmatch (name/phone/city);
claim/merge flow.</p>
<p>Name privacy: public alias allowed; legal name used only for
payouts/verification.</p>
<p>Content policy: portfolio uploader enforces artisticonly;
SafeModeaware previews.</p>
<p>Accessibility: wizards are keyboardable, show step counts, and
preserve focus on validation errors.</p>
<p>Fraud gates: new accounts may have payout reserves (per §3.1).</p>
<p>K) Metrics (per city, first 90 days)</p>
<p>Auth → first action conversion ≥ 65%</p>
<p>Buyer activation (Quick Brief or Saved Search) ≥ 60%</p>
<p>Seller activation (Package publish or Quick Quote) ≥ 55%</p>
<p>Host activation (Studio publish) ≥ 35%</p>
<p>Timetofirst inquiry median: ≤ 3 days (seller), ≤ 7 days (host)</p>
<p>Verification adoption by day 30: ID ≥ 60% (active sellers), Studio
Lite ≥ 50% (active hosts)</p>
<p>Step dropoff &lt; 20% at any wizard step</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.3 FINAL)</p>
<p>Auth supports Email/Apple/Google (+ optional SMS), return URLs, city
capture, Safe Mode default ON, and intent routing
(buyer/seller/host).</p>
<p>Buyer onboarding provides Quick Brief, Search, and Saved Search;
Smart Invites/Broadcast RFP work from Quick Brief.</p>
<p>Seller wizard (per role) collects essentials, packages, availability;
exposes IB/verification unlocks; publishes searchable profiles.</p>
<p>Host wizard collects amenities, rules, pricing, schedule; supports
deposit holds; Studio Lite step; publishes studios.</p>
<p>Linking: People ↔︎ owned Studio chip; host card on studio detail.</p>
<p>Verification Center: ID, Background, Social, Studio Lite with
explicit unlocks and progress.</p>
<p>Safe Mode &amp; FanSub gating enforced during onboarding; SFW
previews on public surfaces.</p>
<p>Save &amp; resume and duplicate detection implemented; alias vs legal
name handled.</p>
<p>Activation metrics instrumented and visible in city rollout
dashboards.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Fast to value: Buyers can send invites within a minute; sellers can
publish a bookable package in one sitting; hosts can list a studio with
clear expectations.</p>
<p>Low friction, high trust: Heavy checks are optional but clearly
rewarding (IB, DM credits, badges, Early Payout).</p>
<p>One account, many hats: Multirole + studio is natural, with simple
linking and context switching.</p>
<p>Measurable &amp; tunable: Activation KPIs let us iterate quickly
citybycity.</p>
<p>§4.4 — Role Profiles (Public &amp; Owner Views)</p>
<p>Goal: Make every role profile a hightrust, bookable storefront that’s
easy to scan, easy to compare, and easy to manage—while keeping People
vs Places distinct, Safe Mode ON by default, and rolescoped reviews
&amp; reputation. Support multirole accounts and optional studio linking
cleanly.</p>
<p>A) Routes &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Public view (role): /{role}/{slug}<br />
Roles: model, photographer, videographer, creator, fan-creator (18+

<p>Fraud guards: multiple reviews from same buyer throttle; unusual
review bursts flagged.</p>
<p>G) Safety, Privacy &amp; Compliance (profile level)</p>
<p>Artisticonly media enforced in uploader; SafeMode previews only in
public/feeds.</p>
<p>No external contact leaks: public profile hides emails/phones;
outbound links limited to verified social icons and case studies.</p>
<p>Chaperone policy visible on Model/Creator profiles; harassment

<p>H) MultiRole UX</p>
<p>Public profile shows role tabs (if user operates multiple).</p>
<p>Start on the role that matched the entry (from search).</p>
<p>Tab switch shows rolespecific packages, reviews, rep, and fields;
keeps Message / Book CTAs contextual to the active role.</p>
<p>Header chips persist (Verified, Trusted Pro) per role; socials are

<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.4 FINAL)</p>
<p>Public role profiles render with Header, Tabs (Portfolio, Packages,
About, Reviews, Updates, Policies), rightrail modules, and sticky
Book/Request on mobile.</p>
<p>Rolespecific fields display correctly and are editable in the owner
editor; nudity tier/chaperone policies for Models/Creators present.</p>
<p>Packages are bookable; Instant Book shows when enabled; Studio AddOn
appears for linked studios and adds to checkout as LBG.</p>
<p>Social metric chips render only when verified connections exist;
unverified links labeled clearly.</p>
<p>Reviews show verifiedbooking first; community references labeled;
owner can reply once; Rep “Why” panel works.</p>
<p>Updates feed posts publish to profile and follower feeds; Follow
count displays.</p>
<p>Tagging &amp; approvals for portfolio items work; collaborator links

sets unless OFF; all media remains SFW on public surfaces.</p>
<p>Owner editor provides Portfolio, Packages, About, Availability,
Policies, Updates, Reviews, Analytics, Link a Studio, and Verification
nudges.</p>
<p>Telemetry events fire as listed; performance &amp; accessibility
targets met.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Bookable storefronts: Every role’s page converts (clear packages,
availability, and CTAs).</p>
<p>Signalrich but simple: Badges, social chips, and a transparent Rep
score reduce risk without clutter.</p>
<p>Multirole clarity: Each role stands on its own merit; switching is
explicit; reviews/reputation never mix.</p>
<p>Network effects: Tagging, case studies, and follows tie profiles
together, lifting discovery and retention.</p>
<p>§4.5 — Studio Listing (Public &amp; Host Views)</p>
<p>Goal: Make studios a clean, trustworthy, creativeready space type
that buyers can book in minutes or attach to a talent checkout—without
turning the product into a venue marketplace. Keep policies, payouts,
reviews, and reputation spacescoped and separate from people roles.</p>
<p>A) Routes &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Public Hub: /studios?city={city} (grid + optional map; amenity
filters).</p>
<p>Public Detail: /studio/{slug} (space page).</p>
<p>Host Create/Edit: /studio/new, /studio/{slug}/edit.</p>
<p>Host Dashboard: /studio/{slug}/dashboard (calendar, bookings, rules,
deposits/claims).</p>
<p>Host Bookings: /studio/{slug}/bookings (list + detail).</p>
<p>Linking: Accounts can link their own Studio to their People profiles
(shows Has/Owns Studio chip on role profile; Host card on studio
page).</p>
<p>B) Public Studio Detail — Layout &amp; Content</p>
<p>Header (above the fold)</p>

only.</p>
<p>Price breakdown (studio subtotal, buyer fee, taxes if
applicable).</p>
<p>IB vs Request: If Instant Book → book now; else send request (host
must accept within X hours, configurable SLA in §3.9).</p>
<p>If user arrived from a talent checkout: show a subtle Linked Booking
Group notice (“This studio will be added to your shoot checkout”).</p>
<p>D) Reviews &amp; Reputation (spacescoped)</p>
<p>Verified booking reviews labeled; Community references allowed with
lower weight and owner approval.</p>
<p>Reputation score (space) shown with breakdown (volume/reviews,
reliability, responsiveness, verification, recency).</p>

<p>Verification status — progress, recheck, appeals.</p>
<p>Promotions — purchase Featured (weekly) / Boost (CPC) if eligible
(usagebased, see §3.3).</p>
<p>Analytics — views, saves, attachinflow selections, IB conversion,
cancellations, adjustment winrate, damage claim rate, revenue.</p>
<p>G) Scheduling &amp; Availability Model</p>
<p>Slots: hourly granularity; min hours and buffers between bookings
(e.g., 30–60 min).</p>
<p>Instant Book windows can be set (e.g., weekdays 9–5); approval
required outside windows.</p>
<p>Blackout dates for maintenance.</p>
<p>Doublebooking protection at payment (live revalidation); collision →
present alternatives.</p>
<p>H) Pricing Model &amp; Fees (studio specifics v1)</p>
<p>Base: $ / hr × hours + min hours; cleaning fee (optional/required);
taxes if applicable.</p>
<p>Deposit hold (authorization) separate from subtotal (not GMV).</p>
<p>Overtime: billed per listing rule (e.g., per 30 minutes at 1.5×) via
PostBooking Adjustment with evidence.</p>
<p>Crew overage / rule violations: adjustment with evidence
(photos/logs).</p>
<p>Platform fees: 12% host, 5% buyer (min $3; 3% ACH if enabled)—see
§3.1 addendum.</p>
<p>Promos: cityspecific (e.g., 0% buyer fee on first studio booking in
founding city).</p>
<p>I) Policies, Safety &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>Refund matrix (studio): defaults ( &gt;7d=100%, 7–48h=50%,
&lt;48h/noshow=0% ); host cancel = full refund + credit; see §3.9
addendum.</p>
<p>Smart Docs mandatory: Property/Space Release, House Rules; Safety
Addendum autoinjects if hazards toggled.</p>
<p>Checkin/out: geofenced timestamps; governs overtime and presence
evidence.</p>
<p>Surveillance: all cameras must be disclosed; none allowed in private
areas (bathrooms, dressing/makeup); signage required; audio disclosure
where required.</p>
<p>Address privacy: exact address visible only postbooking.</p>
<p>Safe Mode: does not gate Studios; studio media must be SFW (it’s fine
to state “suitable for fineart nude photography”).</p>
<p>Minors: host can disallow; otherwise guardian docs required (Phase
2).</p>
<p>J) CrossSell &amp; AttachinFlow</p>
<p>On studio page: “Pair with Talent” opens People search prefiltered to
the studio’s city &amp; chosen date/time.</p>
<p>From talent flows: Attach a Studio drawer presents top studio
matches; selected studio is added to checkout as a Linked Booking Group
(separate policies &amp; payouts).</p>
<p>K) Performance &amp; Accessibility</p>
<p>Media: responsive images (WebP/AVIF), lazyload, no autoplay video on
mobile; alttext required.</p>
<p>Keyboardable filters &amp; calendar; ARIA on tabs; clear focus rings;
large hit areas (44×44).</p>
<p>TTI target: &lt;2.5s (3G Fast) for detail page with skeletons.</p>
<p>L) Telemetry (events)</p>
<p>studio.view • studio.book.start/complete •
studio.request.start/complete</p>
<p>calendar.slot.view • calendar.slot.select • instant_book.toggle</p>
<p>attach_studio.from_profile.open/select</p>

<p>promotions.boost.create • promotions.featured.purchase</p>
<p>analytics.view (host) • verification_lite.start/pass/fail</p>
<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.5 FINAL)</p>
<p>Public studio detail page includes Header (price/hr, min hours,
capacity, Verified Studio, Instant Book), Gallery, Quick Facts,
Amenities, Rules, Availability, Pricing, Host, Location (approx),
Reviews, Pair with Talent module.</p>
<p>Booking widget: date/time &amp; duration, crew size, cleaning fee,
deposit info, Smart Docs preview, IB/Request logic, clear price
breakdown.</p>
<p>Create/Edit wizard implements Basics, Media, Amenities, Rules
(surveillance/hazards), Pricing &amp; Schedule, Deposits &amp; Docs,
Verification Lite, Review &amp; Publish.</p>
<p>Host dashboard provides Calendar, Bookings, Messages, PostBooking
Adjustments, Damage Claims, Rules editor, Verification status,
Promotions, Analytics.</p>
<p>Scheduling supports min hours, buffers, IB windows, blackout dates;
doublebooking protection at payment.</p>
<p>Pricing &amp; fees follow §3.1; deposit holds are authorizations (not
GMV); overtime/overage adjustments implemented with evidence
windows.</p>
<p>Policies &amp; safety enforced: studio refund matrix, Smart Docs
esign before access, geofenced checkin/out, surveillance rules, address
privacy.</p>
<p>AttachinFlow works both directions (from talent checkout drawer and
from studio page to People search) creating a Linked Booking Group at
checkout.</p>
<p>Accessibility/Performance budgets met; Telemetry events fire.</p>
<p>N) Why this works</p>
<p>Clear separation: Studios behave like spaces with their own rules,
deposits, and reviews—no confusion with people roles.</p>
<p>Frictionless planning: Buyers can attach a studio during talent
checkout or start from a studio and find matching talent.</p>
<p>Trust builtin: Verification Lite, Smart Docs, deposits, and
checkin/out create predictable, evidencefirst resolution paths.</p>
<p>Launchready: Tight scope avoids venuemarketplace bloat while
delivering the features creators actually need to shoot.</p>
<p>§4.6 — Search &amp; Results (Roleaware + Studios)</p>
<p>Goal: Make search fast, fair, and creatorspecific. Keep People
(roles) and Places (Studios) distinct but easy to combine. Surface the
right filters for each role, enable perplatform social targeting, and
support AttachinFlow so buyers can add a Studio to a talent checkout in
one pass.</p>
<p>A) Entry Points &amp; Routes</p>
<p>Global Search header button → /search?role={role}&amp;city={city}</p>
<p>Category hubs (e.g., /photographers) deeplink to search prefiltered
by role &amp; city.</p>
<p>Studio hub /studios?city={city} is a specialized search for Studios
(grid + optional map).</p>
<p>AttachinFlow (from Brief/Checkout): opens a Studio drawer preseeded
with city/date/time.</p>
<p>Saved Search links open the same route with filters applied.</p>
<p>Safe Mode is ON by default and gates People results that exceed
“Lingerie/Swim”; Studios are not gated (SFW media only).</p>
<p>B) Layout (Desktop &amp; Mobile)</p>
<p>Desktop</p>
<p>Left: Filter drawer (collapsible).</p>
<p>Center: Results list (cards) with infinite scroll.</p>
<p>Right: Optional map toggle (pins show price or a role icon).</p>
<p>Top: Role/Listing selector tabs (Model • Photographer • Videographer
• Creator • FanSub Creator • Studio), City chip, Date/Time pill, Save
Search.</p>
<p>Mobile</p>
<p>Role tabs at top; Filters opens fullscreen; map toggles within
results.</p>
<p>Sticky bar presents Filters, Save, and (for talent with date/time)
Attach a Studio pill.</p>
<p>Skeletons render immediately; results stream in batches.</p>
<p>C) Role/Listing Selector &amp; Gating</p>
<p>Tabs: People (Model • Photographer • Videographer • Creator • FanSub
Creator) and Places (Studio) separated by a small label.</p>
<p>Safe Mode ON hides FanSubscription Creator and People results with
nudity tiers beyond “Lingerie/Swim.”</p>
<p>Switching to Studio shows Studiospecific filters and never reveals
explicit content.</p>
<p>D) Filters</p>
<p>D1) Common (People &amp; Studios)</p>
<p>City &amp; radius (mi/km)</p>
<p>Date/time window (+ duration for talent packages that require it)</p>
<p>Budget / Price (People: package price; Studio: price/hr)</p>
<p>Distance from city center or buyer’s set location</p>
<p>Availability first (toggle)</p>
<p>Minimum Reputation Score slider</p>
<p>Verification toggles: ID Verified only, Trusted Pro only (People),

ranges)</p>
<p>Genres/Comfort: fashion, beauty, fitness, lingerie/swim, artistic
nude (Y/N), chaperone friendly (Y/N)</p>

<p>Travel: willing to travel (Y/N), touring dates (city list)</p>
<p>D3) People — Photographer</p>
<p>Specialties: portrait, editorial, product, beauty, lifestyle</p>
<p>Deliverables: number of edited images, RAW delivery (Y/N), turnaround
SLA</p>
<p>Licensing tiers: personal, brand organic, paid ads (checkboxes)</p>
<p>Instant Book (toggle)</p>
<p>(Intentionally exclude gear/software; users don’t care at selection
time.)</p>
<p>D4) People — Videographer</p>
<p>Formats: talkinghead, product broll, event, music video,
shortform</p>
<p>Deliverables: length/resolution, color grade, sound mix, captions</p>
<p>Drone license (Y/N), Instant Book toggle</p>
<p>D5) People — FanSubscription Creator (visible only when Safe Mode
OFF)</p>
<p>Platforms offered (OnlyFans, Fansly, Patreon)</p>
<p>Promo types: feed post, story, duet/stitch, link in bio (duration),
collab shoot</p>
<p>Posting window &amp; minlive</p>

<p>Schedule: date/time slot selector; bufferfriendly windows</p>
<p>E) Social Metrics Panel (People roles; perplatform targeting)</p>
<p>Platforms: IG • YT • TT • X (launch).</p>
<p>Filters per platform: Followers (min–max), Engagement Rate (min %),
Avg views (YT/TT), 30/90day growth (min %).</p>
<p>Logic: Match ANY (default) or Match ALL selected platforms.</p>
<p>Verification: Verifiedonly (default) uses connectedaccount metrics;
toggle Include selfreported to expand results (unverified numbers are
labeled).</p>
<p>Freshness: nightly sync; user can Refresh metrics up to 3×/day
platformwide (ratelimited).</p>
<p>Explainers: tooltip “Followers ≠ engagement” + definitions of ER per
platform.</p>
<p>Cards show compact chips like IG 182k • 2.8% ER / TT 520k • 110k avg
views with a tiny verified tick when sourced via API.</p>
<p>F) Results List, Map &amp; Cards</p>
<p>Cards: PersonCard(role) or StudioCard (from §4.2).</p>
<p>Promotions: clearlylabeled Promoted units appear within capped slots
(≤ 2 in top 20, ≤ 1 above the fold); they must match filters.</p>
<p>Map pins: price or role icon; hover/press syncs with the card;
keyboard accessible.</p>
<p>Inline actions: Message, Add to Board, View, Invite (from buyer brief
context).</p>
<p>AttachinFlow (talent searches with date/time): a blue pill “Attach a
Studio” appears above the list; opens the prefiltered Studio drawer (top
3 suggestions inline).</p>
<p>Empty states:</p>
<p>Show nearby neighborhoods, “widen radius,” “adjust budget,” “broaden
date window,” or switch role.</p>
<p>Offer a Save Search with current filters.</p>
<p>G) Sorting &amp; Ranking</p>
<p>Sort options: Best match (default) • Price • Distance • Availability
first • Rating • Reputation.</p>
<p>Ranking (default Best match):</p>
<p>Exact filter fit (role/amenities/social thresholds)</p>
<p>Availability match (date/time fit; for studios, slot + min hours; for
people, IB window or calendar)</p>
<p>Distance (within radius)</p>
<p>Price fit (within selected or inferred range)</p>
<p>Reputation Score (rolespecific; studiospecific for spaces)</p>
<p>Tiebreak nudges: Verified/Trusted/Verified Studio • Instant Book •
Freshness (recent calendar update)</p>
<p>Fairness: Paid units never bypass filter or ranking contract; they
occupy their own labeled, capped slots.</p>
<p>H) Saved Searches &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>Save Search captures all filters (including social panel logic);
users name it and pick alert cadence (daily batch by default).</p>
<p>Email/push previews respect Safe Mode (no 18+ imagery).</p>
<p>Management: /saved-searches lets users rename, change cadence, or
delete.</p>
<p>I) Boards, Compare &amp; Brief Integration</p>
<p>Add to Board from any card; boards can mix People &amp; Studios (type
badges visible).</p>
<p>Compare (from a board or brief): sidebyside with key fields and
rep.</p>
<p>Invite (buyer context): from search cards directly send Smart
Invites; prefills brief context.</p>
<p>Attach a Studio: from talent search with date/time or from brief
review step.</p>
<p>J) Performance, Accessibility &amp; Quality</p>
<p>Performance: route codesplit; image srcset + lazyload; skeletons
render within 100ms; target TTI &lt; 2.5s on 3G Fast.</p>
<p>Accessibility: keyboardable filters &amp; map; ARIA tabs; clear focus
states; card actions readable by screen readers.</p>
<p>Quality: show “metrics stale” badge if social metrics &gt; 72h old;
“calendar stale” badge if not updated for 30 days (optional nudge).</p>

<p>Role/Listing tabs implement
Model/Photographer/Videographer/Creator/FanSub Creator/Studio with
SafeMode gating for FanSub &amp; beyondLingerie People.</p>
<p>Filter sets delivered for each role and for Studio (amenities, min
hours, etc.); Common filters present across all.</p>
<p>Social Metrics Panel supports perplatform followers/ER/avg
views/growth; ANY/ALL logic; Verifiedonly default with Include
selfreported toggle; nightly sync + manual refresh (3×/day).</p>
<p>Results list uses PersonCard / StudioCard; Promoted units are labeled

<p>Attach a Studio pill appears when a People search includes date/time;
drawer shows prefiltered studios; selection persists to checkout as
Linked Booking Group.</p>
<p>Sorting &amp; ranking match the contract: relevance → availability →
distance → price fit → reputation → small nudges; paid never overrides
filters.</p>
<p>Saved Search with cadence (daily batch) implemented; management page
exists.</p>
<p>Boards/Compare/Invite shortcuts work from cards; boards accept mixed
types.</p>
<p>Performance &amp; accessibility budgets met; skeletons present; map
optional; staledata badges visible.</p>
<p>Telemetry events fire as listed.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Roletrue filtering: Buyers get the exact knobs that matter for each
role (and studios), not gear trivia.</p>
<p>Social clarity: Perplatform targeting with verified chips lets brands
and creators find reach + engagement, not just follower tallies.</p>
<p>Fast planning: AttachinFlow collapses multisite planning into one
search + one checkout.</p>
<p>Fair &amp; trustworthy: Relevance and availability rule; promotions
are clearly labeled and capped; Safe Mode protects brand and users.</p>
<p>§4.7 — Checkout &amp; Linked Booking Group</p>
<p>Goal: Make paying predictable, transparent, and safe for both Talent
and Studio bookings—whether purchased alone or together. Treat Talent
and Studio as separate bookings with independent policies &amp; payouts,
but present a single, simple checkout and one receipt when bought
together via an LBG. Minimize dropoff with clear fees, policy previews,
and fast payment flows (Card, ACH).</p>
<p>A) Entry Points &amp; Routes</p>
<p>From People profile (Packages): Book / Request to Book →
/checkout/talent/{tempId}</p>
<p>From Studio page: Instant Book / Request →
/checkout/studio/{tempId}</p>
<p>From Brief/Compare: Award → /checkout/talent/{tempId} (prefilled)</p>
<p>AttachinFlow (talent checkout): adds a Studio →
/checkout/group/{groupId}</p>
<p>Linked Group summary (always when 2 bookings present):
/checkout/group/{groupId}</p>
<p>B) Checkout Structure (single vs group)</p>
<p>Singlebooking Checkout (Talent or Studio)</p>
<p>Details (date/time/duration, package or hourly calc)</p>
<p>Docs (Smart Docs pack)</p>
<p>Payment (card/ACH)</p>
<p>Confirm</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group (Talent + Studio)</p>
<p>Group header with two panels: Talent | Studio (expand/collapse)</p>
<p>Steps: Review → Docs → Payment → Confirm</p>
<p>Policies &amp; totals displayed per booking, with a group total at
bottom.</p>
<p>Atomicity: The LBG confirms only if both bookings succeed
(payments/holds). If one fails, the user sees options to retry, edit, or
remove the failing item.</p>
<p>C) Details Step</p>
<p>Talent panel</p>
<p>Package chosen, addons, price; travel fee calc (zone or permile
beyond included radius), schedule, location (approx).</p>
<p>Instant Book chip if applicable; otherwise “Request to Book” label
with expected response window.</p>
<p>Studio panel</p>
<p>Date/time &amp; min hours check; hourly calc + cleaning fee (if set);
deposit hold badge with amount; rules summary.</p>
<p>Conflicts &amp; validation</p>
<p>Live revalidation of availability for both panels before
continuing.</p>
<p>If collision or minhours violation, inline error + suggested
alternatives (nearby time slots, similar studios).</p>
<p>Group time sync enforced: studio duration must cover talent time (+
configured buffer).</p>
<p>D) Smart Docs Step (esign before pay)</p>
<p>Autoassembled packs (prefilled from booking context):</p>
<p>Talent: SOW, License, Model Release (if needed), Cancellation policy
summary.</p>
<p>Studio: Property/Space Release, House Rules, Safety Addendum
(autoincluded if hazards toggled), Studio cancellation terms.</p>
<p>Esign required to proceed (oneclick signer sheet per doc; audit trail
stored).</p>
<p>Amendments: if details change later (reschedule/adjustments), amended
docs generate automatically and require reack.</p>
<p>Address privacy: Studio’s exact address unlocks after confirmation;
shown in thread + ics attachments.</p>
<p>E) Payment Step</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Card (3DS/SCA when required)</p>
<p>ACH (Plaidlike link) → buyer fee reduced to 3% (min $3) when enabled;
may have delayed confirmation.</p>
<p>Apple Pay / Google Pay (Phase 2) where supported.</p>
<p>What’s charged</p>
<p>Talent: full booking subtotal into escrow (per §1.3).</p>
<p>Studio: full studio subtotal into escrow + deposit hold authorization
(not charged) per listing configuration.</p>
<p>Buyer service fee per booking (5% card / 3% ACH when enabled).</p>
<p>Taxes (if applicable) itemized per booking.</p>
<p>Atomic capture for LBG</p>
<p>Attempt charges/holds in a safe order (e.g., Talent escrow → Studio
escrow → Studio deposit hold).</p>
<p>If any step fails → no booking confirms; guide user to retry or
remove problem item.</p>
<p>Promos &amp; discounts</p>
<p>City promos autoapply (e.g., founding city 0% buyer fee).</p>
<p>Provider fee discounts (IB –1%, Trusted Pro –0.5%) affect provider
payout, not buyer total; shown as “Provider earns more with Instant
Book” tooltip.</p>
<p>Fee transparency</p>
<p>Inline “What do platform fees cover?” tooltip: escrow, contracts,
support, processing.</p>
<p>F) Confirm Step</p>
<p>Success page shows two booking tiles (Talent • Studio) with: status,
dates, “Open thread,” “Add to calendar,” “View Docs,” “Share
itinerary.”</p>
<p>Deposit hold line (Studio): clearly states authorization amount &amp;
automatic release window (e.g., 48h postcheckout if no claim).</p>
<p>Trusted contact prompt (optional safety feature): share generalarea
location &amp; times during the session.</p>
<p>Next actions:</p>
<p>Buyer: “Message” / “Request reschedule” / “Add notes for shoot”</p>
<p>Seller/Host: “Review details” / “Send prep notes” / “Share access
code” (studio)</p>
<p>G) Pricing &amp; Calculations (display rules)</p>
<p>Per booking (panel &amp; receipt lines):</p>
<p>Subtotal (Talent: package + addons + travel; Studio: hours×rate +
cleaning + approved addons)</p>
<p>Buyer fee (5% card / 3% ACH when enabled; min $3; nonrefundable on
buyer cancels per policy)</p>
<p>Estimated taxes (if applicable)</p>
<p>Deposit hold (Studio only; authorization)</p>
<p>Total charged now (escrow amounts)</p>
<p>Group total shown at bottom in LBG; collapsible breakdown.</p>
<p>H) Edits &amp; Reschedules (pre/postconfirmation)</p>
<p>Before confirmation</p>
<p>Edit time, add/remove addons; LBG validates both bookings.</p>
<p>Changing Talent time proposes Studio shift (and viceversa); if not
possible, show split option or alternatives.</p>
<p>After confirmation (flows in thread, per §1.3 addendum)</p>
<p>Propose reschedule to both bookings in LBG; new times quoted &amp;
reauthorized if totals change.</p>
<p>Split LBG if only one party can accommodate change (buyer chooses);
refunds per respective matrices.</p>
<p>Change orders (Talent) &amp; duration changes (Studio) recalc totals;
amended docs issued.</p>
<p>I) Cancellations &amp; Refund Preview</p>
<p>Inline policy previews on each panel with “Learn more” to KB.</p>
<p>Cancellation modal shows computed outcomes per booking (e.g.,
“Talent: 50% refund • Studio: 0% refund”) and a group summary.</p>
<p>Host/Sellerfault cancels: autorefunds buyer fee for that booking;
goodwill credits as configured (§3.9).</p>
<p>J) Receipts &amp; Calendar</p>
<p>Unified receipt with two sections (Talent • Studio), fees, taxes, and
deposit authorization line (Studio).</p>
<p>ICS invites per booking; Linked Group itinerary (combined)
downloadable.</p>
<p>Tax docs stored per booking (not shown at checkout).</p>
<p>K) Error Handling &amp; Edge Cases</p>
<p>Payment declined / 3DS fail: stay on Payment step; show reason; allow
method switch.</p>
<p>Deposit hold fail (Studio): surface amount &amp; bank advice; offer
to remove Studio or retry.</p>
<p>Doublebooking race: if availability disappears between Details and
Pay, show conflict modal with alternatives.</p>
<p>Early exit policy note (Studio): no prorata refunds unless host
agrees; checkout governs overtime only.</p>
<p>No rideshare integration at v1: travel is seller configurable; buyers
may arrange transport independently.</p>
<p>L) Accessibility, Performance &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>Accessibility: logical heading order; labeled inputs; ARIA for
steppers and docs list; keyboardable signature.</p>
<p>Performance: TTI &lt; 2.5s; defer SDKs (ACH/OAuth/3DS) until opened;
skeletons for panels; cache price calcs clientside.</p>
<p>Privacy: exact studio address hidden until confirm; only general area
shown prior; emails/push never contain 18+ previews.</p>
<p>M) Telemetry</p>
<p>checkout.open (type=talent|studio|group)</p>
<p>checkout.validate.ok/fail
(reason=availability|min_hours|conflict)</p>
<p>docs.sign (doc type) • docs.amend.issued/accepted</p>
<p>payment.method.select (card|ach) • payment.attempt.success/fail
(reason)</p>
<p>deposit.authorize.success/fail (amount)</p>
<p>checkout.confirm.success (single|group)</p>
<p>cancel.preview.open • cancel.submit (outcome per booking)</p>
<p>reschedule.propose/accept (group=Y/N)</p>
<p>promo.apply (city_promo|code)</p>
<p>fee.tooltip.view (engagement proxy)</p>
<p>N) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.7 FINAL)</p>
<p>Single &amp; group checkouts implemented with steppers, perbooking
panels, and a group total for LBG.</p>
<p>Smart Docs packs (Talent: SOW/License/Release; Studio: Property/Space
Release + House Rules + Safety Addendum) are esigned before payment;
amended docs reissued on changes.</p>
<p>Payment supports Card and ACH (ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% when
enabled); handles 3DS; logs outcomes.</p>
<p>Escrow collected per booking; Studio deposit hold authorized (not
GMV).</p>
<p>Atomic LBG: both bookings must succeed or none confirm; failure
guidance provided.</p>
<p>Policies &amp; refunds previewed per booking; cancellation modal
computes outcomes; receipts show split lines and deposit
authorization.</p>
<p>Reschedule &amp; change order flows are LBGaware (sync or split),
with reauth when totals change.</p>
<p>Travel fees (Talent) calculated from role settings (zones/mi beyond
included radius).</p>
<p>Accessibility, performance, privacy baselines met; telemetry events
fire.</p>
<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Confidence to commit: Contracts signed before money moves; fees and
policies are crystalclear.</p>
<p>Simple for buyers, correct for finance: One checkout &amp;
receipt—even for two bookings—while ledgers stay separate.</p>
<p>Fewer support tickets: Evidencefirst docs, deposit holds, and policy
previews reduce disputes.</p>
<p>Launchready: Card + ACH, IB + Request, and AttachinFlow cover the
common paths without building a full billing platform.</p>
<p>§4.8 — Delivery Room &amp; Acceptance</p>
<p>Goal: Provide a storagesane, evidencefirst workspace for handing off
creative work, managing proofs → selects → finals, verifying promo/UGC
deliverables, and closing out bookings with clear acceptance timers that
trigger payouts and reduce disputes.</p>
<p>A) Routes &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Buyer view: /booking/{id}/delivery (read/approve/request
revisions).</p>
<p>Seller view: /booking/{id}/delivery (author/publish/revise).</p>
<p>Studio bookings: show readonly timeline (checkin/out, docs); no
Delivery Room (studios don’t deliver files).</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group: each booking has its own Delivery Room; LBG
summary links to each.</p>
<p>B) Concepts &amp; Stages</p>
<p>Manifest — authoritative list of deliverables (filenames/links +
checksums, size, type, version).</p>
<p>Proofs — lowres watermarked images / lowbitrate proxies for video; no
originals on platform.</p>
<p>Selects — buyer picks which proofs should be finalized (if package
includes selection).</p>
<p>Finals — fullspec outputs referenced via external links
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3) + optional onplatform proxy; license applies
on acceptance.</p>
<p>UGC/Promo — a verified post on IG/YT/TT/X with link and API check +
required minlive window.</p>
<p>Storagesane principle: We host previews/proxies only; originals stay
at the source. We capture a manifest and verify integrity (hash), so
disputes can be adjudicated without hosting 100GB+ assets.</p>
<p>C) Typical Workflow</p>
<p>Prepare &amp; Upload Proofs (seller)</p>
<p>Create a Delivery batch → add Proofs (images/videos) with auto
watermark/proxy.</p>
<p>Add External Links (optional) for previewing higher quality; platform
immediately stores manifest metadata (name, ext, size, checksum,
provider, URL).</p>
<p>Autochecks (see §F) run and annotate items.</p>
<p>Buyer Reviews Proofs</p>
<p>Grid/lightbox with zoom; peritem comments (and timecode comments for
video).</p>
<p>Buyer Selects up to the package count (e.g., 12 edits).</p>
<p>If package includes no selection step (e.g., “deliver all 20”), skip
to Finals.</p>
<p>Publish Finals (seller)</p>
<p>For each selected item (or the whole set), upload Final proxies and
attach External Links to originals.</p>
<p>Mark items Final; system locks proof download (if enabled) and
exposes Final download links.</p>
<p>Add License terms chip (pulled from package preset) and Usage window
if applicable.</p>
<p>Acceptance Window starts</p>
<p>Default 7 days (configurable per package: 3/7/14 days).</p>
<p>Buyer can Accept all or specific items, or Request revision (counts
toward package revision rounds).</p>
<p>Autoaccept triggers when the window expires with no action.</p>
<p>UGC/Promo: acceptance occurs when post verifies (API or link) and
remains live for the minlive window (e.g., 72h) — see §E.</p>
<p>Closeout</p>
<p>On Acceptance/Autoaccept, talent booking moves to Completed; payout
queues per §1.3/§3.1.</p>
<p>Leave a review prompt for both sides.</p>
<p>D) Roles &amp; Deliverable Types (what’s supported v1)</p>
<p>Photographer / Videographer: proofs → selects (optional) → finals;
peritem comments, timecoded notes; revision rounds per package.</p>
<p>Model (as seller): usually no file delivery; deliverables are
Time/Service + signed Model Release (already in Smart Docs). Optional:
selfie IDmatch (phase 2).</p>
<p>UGC Creator / FanSubscription Creator (promo work): Post verification
deliverables:</p>
<p>Link to post + screenshot on publish; platform fetches post ID,
timestamp, initial metrics (where APIs allow).</p>
<p>System tracks minlive (e.g., 72h) + post window (e.g., 7 days).</p>
<p>Acceptance after minlive + verification (see §E).</p>
<p>Studio: no deliverables; checkin/out + docs + deposit flows
instead.</p>
<p>E) UGC/Promo Verification (Creators &amp; FanSub Creators)</p>
<p>At delivery: seller submits link to the post (IG/YT/TT/X) + optional
screenshot.</p>
<p>Verification check (hourly during window):</p>
<p>Confirms post exists, is public, matches handle, and the timestamp ≥
booking delivery time.</p>
<p>Logs engagement metrics snapshot (ER proxy) where APIs permit (or
displays “unverified metrics” for linkonly).</p>
<p>Minlive enforcement: track continuous visibility for N hours (package
default 72h; configurable per deliverable).</p>
<p>Acceptance rule: autoaccept on passing verification + minlive, or
manual accept earlier by buyer.</p>
<p>Edge cases: post removed/hidden before minlive → seller can repost
once without restarting the entire acceptance window; noncompliance →
buyer may open refund request (policy per §3.9).</p>
<p>Safe Mode note: We neither fetch nor display 18+ media; SFW
thumbnails only; for FanSub Creators we record confirmation and metrics
sans explicit previews.</p>
<p>F) AutoChecks &amp; Evidence (objective validation)</p>
<p>On upload or link attach:</p>
<p>Technical:</p>
<p>Images: resolution (≥ target px), color space (sRGB/Adobe RGB),
aspect ratio, file type, filesize, EXIF presence.</p>
<p>Video: container/codec (MP4/H.264 or ProRes proxy), resolution, fps,
audio channels, duration.</p>
<p>Integrity: virus scan; checksum recorded (SHA256) for proofs/finals
(and for external manifests when possible).</p>
<p>Policy guards: NSFW detection warning (so sellers avoid borderline
public previews); SafeMode validation on previews.</p>
<p>Link checks: provider type (Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3), reachability,
headers (size/type), and expiry status.</p>
<p>Evidence pack: autocollects manifest, checks, and timestamps; used in
disputes.</p>
<p>G) Revisions &amp; Comments</p>
<p>Revision rounds: default 1 round (configurable per package); seller
can grant extras inthread.</p>
<p>Peritem comments (images); timecoded comments (video); resolve state
for each comment.</p>
<p>Change requests must be actionable (UI enforces structured notes:
crop, color, retouch notes, timecode ranges).</p>
<p>Timers: buyer must submit revision request within the acceptance
window; seller SLA per package (e.g., 3 business days).</p>
<p>H) Downloads &amp; Watermarks</p>
<p>Proofs: watermarked, previewonly (download toggle off by
default).</p>
<p>Finals: download links visible immediately on publish, or after
acceptance (package option).</p>
<p>External originals: always via provider’s storage
(Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/S3/S3 presigned); we never host originals.</p>
<p>Retention: onplatform proxies kept 90 days; manifests retained 12–24
months; banner clarifies “Not a backup service.”</p>
<p>I) Acceptance, Autoaccept &amp; Payout Triggers</p>
<p>Acceptance window: default 7 days (3/7/14 options).</p>
<p>Manual Accept: buyer can accept itemlevel or whole batch; license
certificate issues instantly.</p>
<p>Autoaccept: when timer ends without open revision; licenses issue
automatically; payout queues.</p>
<p>Partial acceptance: allowed; payout apportions across accepted items
if package contracted peritem pricing; otherwise paid on batch
acceptance.</p>
<p>UGC/Promo: acceptance on verify + minlive; payout scheduled
afterwards.</p>
<p>Early Payout (peruse): eligible sellers (Rep ≥ 85) can accelerate
postacceptance.</p>
<p>J) Disputes &amp; NonDelivery</p>
<p>Missing deliverables (seller uploaded fewer than contracted): buyer
opens Refund Request; system compares contracted vs manifest; partial
refunds computed.</p>
<p>Quality disputes (offspec): rely on Autochecks + SOW to determine
deviation; may provide partial refund or revision credit.</p>
<p>Expired external links: seller must refresh within 48h of buyer
notice; timers pause during refresh grace; repeated expiry → reputation
hit.</p>
<p>Escalation to Neutral Review (per §3.9): evidence pack includes
manifest, checks, comments, timestamps, link status, and SOW terms.</p>
<p>Studios: route to studio deposit/adjustment flows (no file
disputes).</p>
<p>K) Security, Privacy &amp; Policy</p>
<p>Virus scanning on all uploads; block executables; safe MIME
validation.</p>
<p>EXIF privacy: warn on personal EXIF; provide “strip on proxy”
option.</p>
<p>DMCA &amp; IP: report flow; lock downloads when claim is open; notify
both parties.</p>
<p>Safe Mode: only SFW previews visible publicly; buyer &amp; seller see
full content subject to policy; FanSub flows avoid explicit
previews.</p>
<p>L) UI Details (components &amp; states)</p>
<p>ManifestList with status chips: Proof • Final • Needs action • Error
• Link expired.</p>
<p>AutoCheckStatus: green/yellow/red with tooltips (e.g., “Video exceeds
4GB proxy limit; original link captured”).</p>
<p>Comment sidebar (per item) with timecodes &amp; resolve
checkboxes.</p>
<p>Timer banner: shows Acceptance ends in Xd Xh; pauses if revision
round is open.</p>
<p>License chip on each Final; View License opens certificate modal
(terms, project, booking ID).</p>
<p>UGC tracker: “Verifying post…” → “Live ✓ (48/72h remaining)” →
“Verified ✓”.</p>
<p>M) Notifications &amp; Emails</p>
<p>Seller: “Buyer selected X proofs” • “Revision requested on N items” •
“Acceptance complete”</p>
<p>Buyer: “Finals ready” • “Acceptance ends in 24h” • “UGC post failed
verification (reason)”</p>
<p>Both: “Autoaccept in 3h” • “Links expired—action required”</p>
<p>Emails respect Safe Mode (no explicit previews).</p>
<p>N) Metrics</p>
<p>Time to first delivery, time to acceptance, % autoaccept, revision
rate, firstpass acceptance rate, link failure rate, nondelivery
incidents, refund rate, UGC verification pass rate, minlive compliance
rate.</p>
<p>Feed Reputation inputs: ontime delivery, revision compliance,
nondelivery, link reliability.</p>
<p>O) Telemetry (events)</p>
<p>delivery.batch.create/publish • delivery.item.add/remove •
delivery.link.attach/refresh/expire</p>
<p>autocheck.pass/warn/fail (reason) • virus.block</p>
<p>proofs.view • selects.add/remove • finals.publish</p>
<p>accept.open/accept.all/accept.some/auto_accept</p>
<p>revision.request/open/resolve (counts, per item)</p>
<p>ugc.verify.start/pass/fail • ugc.min_live.progress</p>
<p>refund_request.open/resolve (outcome)</p>
<p>license.certificate.view/download</p>
<p>P) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.8 FINAL)</p>
<p>Delivery Room supports Proofs → Selects (optional) → Finals with
peritem comments and timecoded notes for video.</p>
<p>External link manifest captured (name, size, type, checksum where
available, provider, URL); no original hosting; proxies/previews
only.</p>
<p>Autochecks run on upload/link; results shown per item; virus scan
enforced.</p>
<p>Acceptance window (3/7/14 days) with Autoaccept; partial acceptance
supported; payout triggers wired.</p>
<p>UGC/Promo verification: link ingest, API checks when available,
minlive tracking, acceptance on verify+minlive.</p>
<p>Revisions: at least 1 round configurable; structured change requests;
timers pause during active revision.</p>
<p>Downloads &amp; watermarks: proofs watermarked; finals downloadable
per package rule; retention &amp; “not a backup” banner visible.</p>
<p>Disputes: nondelivery/quality/linkexpiry flows with evidence packs;
timers &amp; outcomes integrate with §3.9.</p>
<p>Safe Mode &amp; policy: SFW previews only; FanSub Creator flows avoid
explicit media.</p>
<p>Telemetry &amp; metrics instrumented as listed.</p>
<p>Q) Why this works</p>
<p>Reduces disputes: Objective manifests, autochecks, and acceptance
timers create shared reality.</p>
<p>Scales cheaply: Proxies + external links avoid massive storage costs
while preserving evidence.</p>
<p>Fits every role: Photographers/video get proofs→finals; creators get
verified posts; studios don’t carry file baggage.</p>
<p>Clear payout triggers: Acceptance (or verified minlive) drives
completion; LBG clarity remains intact.</p>
<p>§4.9 — Messaging &amp; Threads — FINAL</p>
<p>Goal: Provide a fast, safe, and actioncentric inbox where buyers,
talent, and studio hosts coordinate work. Threads must: (1) reduce
backandforth via Quick Actions (quote, reschedule, change order,
refunds), (2) keep evidence attached (docs, delivery, checkin/out), and
(3) respect our fairuse DM credits, Safe Mode, and offplatform payment
guardrails.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Do work in the thread — Quotes, schedule changes, docs, delivery,
adjustments, refunds are all firstclass actions.</p>
<p>Context everywhere — Each thread shows role/space, booking status,
and key policy snippets.</p>
<p>Evidence over opinion — Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, and price math.</p>
<p>Safe by default — Hide personal contact info; scan attachments;
offplatform payment attempts are discouraged and throttled.</p>
<p>Low friction — Replies are free; new conversation credits are the
only scarce resource (per §3.2).</p>
<p>LBGaware — When Talent + Studio are booked together, keep threads
separate but coordinated, with Group Broadcast when needed.</p>
<p>B) Thread Types &amp; Routing</p>
<p>Inquiry thread (prebooking) — starts from profile/search/brief
invite. Uses DM credit on the first outbound message only; replies are
free.</p>
<p>Booking thread (Talent) — created on acceptance/IB; status chips:
Booked → In progress → Delivered → Completed; shows escrow status.</p>
<p>Booking thread (Studio) — created on acceptance/IB; shows access
details (masked until esign), deposit hold state, checkin/out
status.</p>
<p>RFP thread — buyer broadcast → provider reply; converts to
Inquiry/Booking on award.</p>
<p>LBG umbrella — not a chat; a summary bar linking to the two booking
threads; supports Group Broadcast (see §I).</p>
<p>Routes: /messages (list) • /messages/{threadId} (detail) •
/messages?group={groupId} (shows both group threads with Broadcast
control)</p>
<p>C) Layout (Thread Detail)</p>
<p>Header bar</p>
<p>Counterpart avatar &amp; name • Role/Studio chip • City • Booking
status chip • Rep ring (0–100) mini • “View booking” • “View docs”</p>
<p>Rightside actions: Quick Quote / Change Order / Propose Reschedule /
Issue Refund / Get help (contextual, role/space aware)</p>
<p>Left (or main) pane</p>
<p>Message list (bubbles with timestamps, read receipts, link previews,
inline image/video previews with SafeMode filtering)</p>
<p>Pinned message (e.g., access code) shown atop until unpinned</p>
<p>Right (or drawer) pane</p>
<p>Summary card (dates, times, location neighborhood, price lines)</p>
<p>Docs (SOW, License, Release; Studio: Property/Space Release, House
Rules)</p>
<p>Delivery status (if talent thread)</p>
<p>Checkin/out (if studio thread)</p>
<p>Policies mini cards (cancel/refund window)</p>
<p>Group chip if part of LBG (tap to switch thread or use Broadcast)</p>
<p>D) Composer &amp; Message Types</p>
<p>Text (rich formatting minimal: bold, list, link)</p>
<p>Attachments: images, short clips (previewed), PDFs; virusscanned and
SafeMode filtered in public previews</p>
<p>Snippets/Templates: canned replies by role; perrole variables (price,
slots, packages)</p>
<p>Scheduling poll (propose 2–5 times)</p>
<p>Quick Quote (inline price proposal from package + addons → turns into
a booking when accepted)</p>
<p>Location picker (neighborhood only; exact studio address never sent
until docs signed)</p>
<p>Voice notes (Phase 2; text transcript required if enabled)</p>
<p>Emoji/ack (👍 etc.) to reduce noise</p>
<p>Credit logic:</p>
<p>Starting a new thread consumes 1 credit (per §3.2).</p>
<p>Replies, booking threads, and RFP replies do not consume credits.</p>
<p>If messages breach spam checks, sending slows or blocks (see §G).</p>
<p>E) Pipeline, Automation &amp; Reminders</p>
<p>Pipeline chips (auto): New • Needs Info • Quoted • Awarded • Booked •
Delivered • Completed</p>
<p>Autonudges (1/day max/thread) when: quote unanswered 48h, buyer
hasn’t proposed times, docs unsigned, delivery unreviewed.</p>
<p>Snooze a thread (until date/time or after event).</p>
<p>Remind me later on action items (e.g., “Follow up on Tuesday”).</p>
<p>F) Quick Actions (contextual, policyaware)</p>
<p>Quick Quote (Inquiry → Booking)</p>
<p>Pick a package, adjust addons, travel, discounts; preview
fee/takehome; send quote.</p>
<p>Buyer taps Accept &amp; Pay → goes to Talent checkout (or LBG if
studio already attached).</p>
<p>Propose Reschedule (Booking)</p>
<p>Propose new date/time (Talent or Studio); if LBG, system proposes
synchronized change to both bookings.</p>
<p>If only one can move, buyer picks: Split group or Change both
later.</p>
<p>Change Order (Talent)</p>
<p>Add hours, addons, license tier changes; requote and reauthorize;
amended Smart Docs issued.</p>
<p>Issue Refund / Discount (Talent)</p>
<p>Partial refund or discount (policyaware); provider fee recalculates;
receipts reissued.</p>
<p>Studio: Share Access / Update Code</p>
<p>Access code (masked until both docs signed) • Parking/entry notes •
Backup contact.</p>
<p>Audit log for code reveals/updates.</p>
<p>Studio: PostBooking Adjustment</p>
<p>Overtime/crew overage/violation; attach photos/logs; opens adjustment
claim (per §3.9 timers).</p>
<p>Delivery: Request Acceptance / Request Revision</p>
<p>Inline buttons appear when the stage is appropriate.</p>
<p>Support: Get help</p>
<p>Opens contextual selfserve (refund, access issue,
adjustment/dispute), attaching evidence from the thread.</p>
<p>All actions produce system messages with links to receipts, docs, or
delivery items.</p>
<p>G) Safety, Privacy &amp; Abuse Controls</p>
<p>Autoredact obvious phone/email/payment handles prebooking; after
confirmation, allow a masked relay number/email (Phase 2) or keep inapp
only at v1.</p>
<p>Offplatform payment detection → inline reminder + link to Protection
benefits; repeat attempts throttle new thread creation.</p>
<p>Harassment &amp; slur filter → soft block + “Report” affordance; P0
safety escalations surface hotline.</p>
<p>Attachment guards → virus scan, MIME/type check, SafeMode preview
compliance; large files rejected with Delivery guidance.</p>
<p>Block/Mute other party; Report with categories (misrepresentation,
harassment, payment circumvention, explicit content).</p>
<p>Privacy: toggle Read receipts ON/OFF per user (default ON); Last seen
off by default.</p>
<p>H) Inbox (List) &amp; Search</p>
<p>Unified inbox with folders: All, Action needed, Booked, Archived.</p>
<p>Sort: Recent activity (default) • Unread first • By pipeline
stage.</p>
<p>Filters: Role (if multirole), Studio (if host), City, Has booking,
Has docs pending, Has delivery pending.</p>
<p>Search within inbox: counterpart name, project title, booking ID.</p>
<p>Archive &amp; Pin threads; archive autoreopens on new activity.</p>
<p>I) LBGAware Collaboration</p>
<p>Group bar on talent or studio booking thread shows the partner
booking card with status and a “Broadcast to both” toggle.</p>
<p>Broadcast sends a message to both threads with a banner “Sent to both
bookings”; replies arrive in respective threads (kept separate for
policy/payout reasons).</p>
<p>Reschedules launched from either thread attempt to update both
bookings; system explains outcomes if only one can move.</p>
<p>Docs &amp; delivery remain per booking; crosslinks appear in the
group bar.</p>
<p>J) Timezones, Localization &amp; Calendars</p>
<p>All timestamps show local time for each user; hover reveals UTC and
other party’s local time.</p>
<p>Date/time proposals include both parties’ local times in the message
bubble.</p>
<p>ICS attachments created on booking and on accepted reschedules.</p>
<p>K) Reliability &amp; Performance</p>
<p>Optimistic send with retry; duplicate protection (idempotent
keys).</p>
<p>Typing and read indicators; fall back gracefully on poor
networks.</p>
<p>Attachment uploads show progress; resume on reconnect.</p>
<p>Message retention: durable; no hard expiry.</p>
<p>L) Telemetry</p>

<p>M) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.9 FINAL)</p>
<p>Thread types implemented (Inquiry, Booking—Talent/Studio, RFP) with
role/space context and status chips.</p>
<p>Composer supports text, attachments, templates, scheduling polls,
Quick Quote; SafeMode filtering for previews.</p>
<p>Quick Actions live and policyaware: Quick Quote, Propose Reschedule,
Change Order, Issue Refund/Discount, Studio Access, PostBooking
Adjustment.</p>
<p>LBGaware features: group bar, Broadcast, synchronized reschedules
with split option.</p>
<p>Read receipts, typing, pin, archive, inbox filters/search delivered;
DM credit spend only on first outbound of new threads.</p>
<p>Safety: offplatform detection, harassment filter, virus scan,
block/mute/report; personal contact hidden prebooking; access codes
masked until esign.</p>
<p>Evidence autoattached: docs, delivery links, checkin/out, receipts;
system messages for every action.</p>
<p>Time zone clarity in proposals and timestamps; ICS updated on
reschedule.</p>
<p>Performance: optimistic sends, retry, upload progress; telemetry
fires as listed.</p>
<p>N) Why this works</p>
<p>Fewer support touches: The thread is a control panel—quotes,
reschedules, refunds, and adjustments live where the conversation
happens.</p>
<p>Safer &amp; cleaner: Guardrails reduce fraud and harassment without
blocking legit coordination.</p>
<p>LBG clarity without confusion: Keep bookings separate for
policy/payout, yet coordinate via Group Broadcast and synchronized
changes.</p>
<p>Frictionlight: Replies are free; credits only gate outbound cold
outreach, which protects buyers and keeps the inbox healthy.</p>
<p>§4.10 — Reviews &amp; Reputation UX</p>
<p>Goal: Make feedback trustworthy, fair, and hard to game—so buyers can
choose confidently and providers/hosts know what to improve. Keep
reviews rolescoped for People and spacescoped for Studios. Use a
transparent 0–100 Reputation Score that’s explainable, timeweighted, and
tied to real outcomes (ontime delivery, noshow rate, safety). Respect
Safe Mode, privacy, and legal boundaries.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Only from real jobs: Public star/text reviews come only from
completed, onplatform bookings (verified by escrow + acceptance).</p>
<p>Doubleblind &amp; timeboxed: Neither side sees the other’s review
until both submit or the window closes.</p>
<p>Role/space scoped: Reviews and reputation never mix across roles;
studios have their own reputation.</p>
<p>Evidence beats rhetoric: Where relevant, the UI shows objective
signals (checkin/out, delivery timestamps, UGC minlive pass).</p>
<p>Safety first: Provide a private safety feedback channel separate from
public reviews; enforce antiharassment and antidoxxing rules.</p>
<p>Explain the math: The Reputation Score always has a “Why this score?”
breakdown and decay timeline.</p>
<p>B) Triggers &amp; Windows</p>
<p>Trigger to review:</p>
<p>Talent bookings: on Acceptance or Autoaccept in Delivery Room.</p>
<p>Studios: at checkout complete (after checkout time passes and no open
access issue).</p>
<p>Window: 14 days from trigger for both parties.</p>
<p>Doubleblind: Reviews publish when both are submitted or at day 14; if
only one submits, both publish at day 14.</p>
<p>Reminders: Day 3, Day 10 nudges; Day13 last call (inapp + email).</p>
<p>Who can review: The buyer and the counterparty (provider or host). No
thirdparty public reviews.</p>
<p>Canceled jobs:</p>
<p>Provider/hostfault cancel: no star review; system records a
reliability penalty visible in the Rep breakdown.</p>
<p>Buyerfault cancel: same (penalty on buyer account; not public).</p>
<p>Noshow: no star review; a Noshow marker feeds reputation
(decays).</p>
<p>C) Review Composer (roleaware)</p>
<p>Common structure</p>
<p>Stars (1–5)</p>
<p>Short tags (2–3 chips)</p>
<p>Optional text (min 30 chars for 1–2★; 4–5★ can be empty)</p>
<p>Photo evidence (SFW only; optional; studios allow space photos;
talent allows BTS SFW)</p>
<p>Private safety feedback (structured, never public; see §H)</p>
<p>Rolespecific tags</p>
<p>Model/Creator: Professional • Punctual • Communication •
Posing/Direction • Boundaries respected • Would book again</p>
<p>Photographer: Direction • Professional • Communication • Turnaround
met • Quality of edits • Clear brief</p>
<p>Videographer: Professional • Audio quality • Color grade • Timely
delivery • Communication</p>
<p>UGC/FanSub Creator: Followed brief • Post verified • Met minlive •
Onbrand • Clear disclosure</p>
<p>Studio (space): Accurate listing • Easy access • Cleanliness • Noise
control • Natural light • Amenities as described</p>
<p>Guardrails</p>
<p>Disallow personal info (emails/phones), hate speech, harassment;
inline warnings with policy links.</p>
<p>Safe Mode ensures no explicit images can be attached.</p>
<p>D) Display &amp; Surfacing</p>
<p>On profiles (People)</p>
<p>Star average + count (shows only after ≥ 3 verified reviews)</p>
<p>Reputation Ring (0–100) with “Why this score?” → breakdown and recent
trend sparkline</p>
<p>Latest reviews (3–5), with Verified booking label; studio reviews
never appear here</p>
<p>Community references in a separate section (low weight,
ownerapproved)</p>
<p>On Studio pages</p>
<p>Star average + count (threshold ≥ 3)</p>
<p>Studio Reputation Ring (spacescoped) with breakdown (reliability
includes deposit claim behavior)</p>
<p>Photo reviews encouraged (SFW), especially of space and amenities</p>
<p>In Search</p>
<p>Rep ring chip on cards; hover/tooltip with score reason</p>
<p>Filters: Min Reputation (0–100) and Min Stars (1–5)</p>
<p>Sort: Top Reputation, Rating, and Recent</p>
<p>E) Reputation Score (0–100) — computation (v1)</p>
<p>Weights (roleaware; spaceaware for studios)</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; volume — 40% (Bayesiansmoothed star mean; more weight
with more reviews; community references capped)</p>
<p>Reliability — 25% (ontime completion, noshow rate, cancel fault,
dispute loss rate; deposit abuse for studios)</p>
<p>Responsiveness — 10% (median first response time; response
consistency)</p>
<p>Verifications — 15% (ID, Trusted Pro, Socialverified, Verified
Studio)</p>
<p>Recent performance — 10% (last 90 days weighted 2×)</p>
<p>Penalties &amp; decay</p>
<p>Late cancellations/noshows/dispute losses apply sharp penalties that
decay over 60–120 days.</p>
<p>Smallsample protection: Bayesian prior (city/role baseline) prevents
“100 after 1 review.”</p>
<p>Caps: Any single factor can affect at most ±12 points per month
(prevents sudden swings).</p>
<p>New accounts: show “New — building reputation” until 3 verified
reviews or 10 completed bookings.</p>
<p>Transparency</p>
<p>“Why this score?” panel shows 5 bars and examples (“2 late
cancellations in last 90 days (–6)”).</p>
<p>“How to improve” checklist (e.g., Enable Instant Book; verify ID;
reply faster; meet delivery SLA).</p>
<p>F) Antigaming &amp; Moderation</p>
<p>Ring detection: repeated mutual 5★ bursts across a tight user cluster
(IP/device/time overlap) → flag; reduce weight; investigate.</p>
<p>Incentivized reviews: explicit quidproquo offers (“5★ for discount”)
are prohibited; detection via text patterns + reports.</p>
<p>Review gating: Providers/hosts cannot prompt reviews with incentives
inthread; system handles prompts neutrally.</p>
<p>One owner response per review; edits allowed for 15 minutes after
posting, then locked (typos only).</p>
<p>Flagging: “Report review” (harassment, personal info, hate, explicit
content, irrelevant, privacy breach).</p>
<p>Outofscope: We don’t remove reviews for mere opinion or star rating;
removal is for policy violations only.</p>
<p>Anonymity options: Buyers can publish under brand/team name; personal
names are hidden by default.</p>
<p>G) LBG (Linked Booking Group) behavior</p>
<p>One postbooking flow invites the buyer to review both bookings
(Talent &amp; Studio) in a single step; each publishes to its own
page.</p>
<p>Reviews remain independent; a studio’s issues don’t lower a
photographer’s rating (and vice versa).</p>
<p>If one booking is canceled by fault, the other may still be
reviewable per its own rules.</p>
<p>H) Safety Feedback (private, nonpublic)</p>
<p>Structured form in the review flow: boundary violations, harassment,
unsafe space, undisclosed cameras, access issues.</p>
<p>Feeds Safety Console with the booking context, checkin/out, docs, and
message snippets.</p>
<p>Not public; may trigger a strike, IB suppression, or verification
recheck; submitter receives outcome summary when resolved.</p>
<p>I) Prompting &amp; Emails (biasfree)</p>
<p>Neutral subject lines and copy (“Share feedback about your
experience”).</p>
<p>No starnudging language; no images that could bias; SFW only.</p>
<p>Onetap stars deeplink on mobile; text field optional except for 1–2★
(reason required).</p>
<p>Followup once if unreviewed; no further nags after day 14.</p>
<p>J) Metrics &amp; Health Targets</p>
<p>Review completion rate ≥ 55% (either side)</p>
<p>Doubleblind submissions ≥ 35% (both sides submitted before day
14)</p>
<p>1–2★ share within expected band (watch for chilling effects)</p>
<p>Disputeadjusted satisfaction (4★+ after successful support
outcome)</p>
<p>Flag rate &lt; 2% of reviews; removal rate &lt; 0.4% (policy
violations only)</p>
<p>Rep score stability (stdev &lt; 6 points over 30 days for steady
accounts)</p>
<p>Correlation: Rep vs conversion uplift (target positive, diminishing
returns past ~85)</p>
<p>K) Telemetry</p>
<p>review.request.sent/open • review.submit (stars, role|studio) •
review.publish</p>
<p>review.flag (reason) • review.owner_response.submit</p>
<p>rep.why.open • rep.improve.view/action</p>
<p>safety_feedback.submit (category)</p>
<p>lbg.review.bundle.start/complete</p>
<p>email.review.open/click (biassafe content)</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.10 FINAL)</p>
<p>Doubleblind reviews with a 14day window; publish when both submit or
on expiry.</p>
<p>Rolescoped reviews &amp; reputation for People; spacescoped for
Studios; never mixed.</p>
<p>Composer includes stars, tags, optional text, SFW photos, and private
safety feedback.</p>
<p>Display: profiles/pages show star average (≥3 reviews), latest
reviews, Reputation Ring with transparent breakdown.</p>
<p>Reputation Score computed with weights (40/25/10/15/10), Bayesian
smoothing, penalties with decay, caps on monthtomonth swing, and “New”
state until minimum data.</p>
<p>Search integrates Rep ring chips, filters (Min Rep/Min Stars), and
sort options.</p>
<p>Antigaming rules enforced: ring detection, no incentives, policybased
removals only; owner reply limits.</p>
<p>LBG review bundle flow implemented; each review publishes to its own
entity.</p>
<p>Safe Mode respected: no explicit media in reviews; emails/push
SFW.</p>
<p>Telemetry &amp; KPIs instrumented as listed.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Trustworthy by design: Only verified bookings yield public reviews;
the rest factor into reliability quietly.</p>
<p>Explainable, not mysterious: The 0–100 score with a clear “why”
builds confidence and guides improvement.</p>
<p>Hard to game, easy to use: Doubleblind timing, smallsample smoothing,
and ring detection keep ratings honest; the UI stays friendly.</p>
<p>Aligns with search &amp; conversions: Strong reputation helps sort
ties without letting paid boosts hijack results.</p>
<p>§4.11 — Support, Refunds &amp; Disputes UX</p>
<p>Goal: Resolve issues quickly, predictably, and fairly with minimal
human touch. Keep everything policyaware, evidencefirst, LBGaware
(Talent + Studio), and feeaccurate (per §3.1). Make outcomes clear
before users commit to a request, and autoassemble evidence (docs,
checkin/out, delivery manifests, deposit settings) to reduce friction
and fraud.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Do it where the work lives: All flows start in the booking thread via
Inthread ▸ Get help; no context loss.</p>
<p>Outcome clarity upfront: Show a refund/charge preview based on policy
matrix and timestamps before submission.</p>
<p>Evidence beats rhetoric: Autoattach Smart Docs, Delivery manifests,
checkin/out, calendar logs, studio access logs, and payment lines.</p>
<p>Separate ledgers: Talent and Studio bookings are independent; LBG
shows a single summary with perbooking outcomes.</p>
<p>Timers &amp; SLAs: Access issues are P1; standard disputes follow
strict windows (24h/48h/5day).</p>
<p>Chargebackready: Every case builds a representment pack by
default.</p>
<p>SFW &amp; privacy: No explicit media; exact studio address hidden
except to parties; Safe Mode respected in notifications.</p>
<p>B) Entry Points &amp; Routes</p>
<p>Thread shortcut: Inthread ▸ Get help (contextual forms)</p>
<p>Profile menu: Support Center /support → lists bookings + cases</p>
<p>Booking detail: Open a case button</p>
<p>Admin: Support Console /admin/support (agentonly)</p>
<p>C) Case Types (policyaware, minimal)</p>
<p>Talent bookings</p>
<p>Refund request – cancellation (buyerinitiated; applies §3.9 talent
matrix)</p>
<p>Nondelivery / missing items (compare SOW vs manifest)</p>
<p>Offspec quality (autochecks vs SOW; may route to revision first)</p>
<p>Noshow / late arrival (uses checkin/out evidence)</p>
<p>Payment correction (duplicate charge, tax error)</p>
<p>Studio bookings</p>
<p>Access issue (live) → P1 (badge); resolves or refunds per §3.9
addendum</p>
<p>Damage claim (hostinitiated; deposit hold)</p>
<p>Postbooking adjustment (overtime, crew overage, rule violation)</p>
<p>Amenity misrepresentation (partial refund if material)</p>
<p>Payment correction</p>
<p>Linked Booking Group (LBG)</p>
<p>Group cancel/split (compute separate outcomes; show one summary)</p>
<p>Group reschedule (sync both bookings or split)</p>
<p>Mixed dispute (e.g., Talent deliverables issue + Studio OK)</p>
<p>D) SelfServe Triage Wizard (all flows)</p>
<p>Step 1 — Identify issue</p>
<p>Contextaware options (e.g., “Access code not working” on Studio;
“Delivered fewer images than contracted” on Talent).</p>
<p>Step 2 — Policy preview</p>
<p>Show matrix snippet (e.g., “&gt;7d=100%, 7–48h=50%, &lt;48h=0%”),
countdown timers, and estimated outcomes (refund lines per booking,
buyer fee policy, deposit note).</p>
<p>If outcome is clearly $0, offer “Contact seller/host” instead of
filing.</p>
<p>Step 3 — Evidence (auto + user)</p>
<p>Autoattached: checkin/out (Studio), SOW/License/House Rules, Delivery
manifest, Autochecks, messages timeline, price lines, deposit
configuration, access logs (if integrated).</p>
<p>User prompts: upload photos/video (SFW), describe discrepancy; link
to UGC post when relevant.</p>
<p>Step 4 — Review &amp; submit</p>
<p>Show refund/charge preview with taxes/fees; LBG outcome split if
group; submit → case created.</p>
<p>Confirmation</p>
<p>Thread posts a system message summarizing the case; both parties get
actions (Respond / Add evidence).</p>
<p>E) Evidence &amp; Calculations (what the engine uses)</p>
<p>Talent: SOW (deliverables count/spec), Delivery manifest
(filenames/checksums), Autochecks (resolution, codecs), acceptance
timestamps, revision rounds used, messages referencing scope.</p>
<p>Studio: checkin/out geofence pass/fail, House Rules signatures,
access logs, pre/post photos, schedule vs booked, crew count note,
hazard toggles &amp; Safety Addendum.</p>
<p>Financials: escrow amounts, provider fee, buyer fee, tax lines,
deposit authorization, promotions/discounts.</p>
<p>Outcome logic: applies matrices from §3.9; refund buyer fee only on
provider/hostfault or safety exceptions; deposit captures no platform
fee (per §3.1 addendum).</p>
<p>F) Case Lifecycle &amp; States</p>
<p>Open (awaiting counterparty) — autodeadline set (48h respond).</p>
<p>Evidence needed — requester must add missing items (48h).</p>
<p>Proposed resolution — party has 48h to accept/decline.</p>
<p>Neutral Review — agent evaluates evidence; target decision ≤ 5
business days.</p>
<p>Resolved — refund/charge issued; receipts &amp; amended docs
generated.</p>
<p>Closed — telemetry logged; affects Reputation and future eligibility
(IB/boosts).</p>
<p>Fastlane closures</p>
<p>Access failure (host fault) → immediate refund of Studio; buyer fee
waived; goodwill credit optional.</p>
<p>Talent providercancel → immediate buyer refund; buyer fee waived;
reputation penalty.</p>
<p>G) Timers &amp; SLAs (confirming §3.9 addendum)</p>
<p>Studio access (live): P1; first response ≤ 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Damage claim window (host): open ≤ 24h after checkout; buyer response
48h.</p>
<p>Adjustment window (studio): open ≤ 24h; buyer response 48h.</p>
<p>Nondelivery (talent): buyer opens within acceptance window or ≤ 7
days post autoaccept; seller response 48h.</p>
<p>Neutral Review decision: ≤ 5 business days after evidence
windows.</p>
<p>Deposit autorelease: 48h postcheckout if no claim.</p>
<p>H) Case Views (User &amp; Agent)</p>
<p>User case detail</p>
<p>Timeline (events, deadlines), Outcome calculator panel, evidence list
(auto + uploaded), Proposed resolution, Accept/Decline buttons, messages
subthread.</p>
<p>Agent console /admin/support</p>
<p>Case list with SLA badges; filters; macros.</p>
<p>LBG outcome split view (Talent | Studio) with oneclick apply of
both.</p>
<p>Deposit actions (authorize/void/capture with amount + reason);
evidence viewer.</p>
<p>Sanctions (toggle IB off, suppress boosts, visibility throttle);
strike ladder shortcuts.</p>
<p>Representment kit export (PDF + evidence images/logs).</p>
<p>Templates: Access failure (host remedy/credit), Adjustment
approved/denied, Damage approved/denied, Talent nondelivery partial.</p>
<p>I) Money Movement &amp; Docs</p>
<p>Refunds: autoissue to original method; partials itemized; tax
recalculated; buyer fee refunded per rules.</p>
<p>Adjustments (studio): create new charge from escrow (if available) or
postcharge with receipt.</p>
<p>Deposit capture: separate, up to cap; no platform fee; receipt with
evidence link.</p>
<p>Amended docs: SOW/House Rules/Release updates autoissued on material
change orders.</p>
<p>J) Special Cases &amp; Guards</p>
<p>UGC/promo noncompliance: if post removed before minlive, the seller
gets one retry; else partial refund per package policy.</p>
<p>Expired external links: seller has 48h to refresh; timer pauses;
repeated expiry → reputation penalty.</p>
<p>Fraud guard: repeated loss in disputes → IB off and promotion
suppression; investigation flag to Safety.</p>
<p>Chargebacks: we do not charge a dispute fee unless clear abuse;
otherwise platform absorbs processor fee.</p>
<p>K) Knowledge Base &amp; Inflow Help</p>
<p>Inline “Learn more” links from each form screen go to KB:</p>
<p>Talent refunds, Studio refunds, LBG outcomes, Damage deposits,
Overtime/overage, UGC verification, Delivery &amp; acceptance,

<p>Inthread Get help launches contextual triage with policy preview,
evidence autoattach, and refund/charge preview.</p>
<p>Case types live for Talent, Studio, and LBG; Access issue is P1 with
fast lane to resolve/refund.</p>
<p>LBG outcome split view shows separate Talent/Studio results and a
single group summary.</p>
<p>Damage deposits: authorize/void/capture supported; no platform fee on
deposit capture.</p>
<p>Postbooking adjustments (overtime/overage/violation) supported with
evidence and timers.</p>
<p>UGC/promo verification integrated; minlive failures handled with one
retry then policy outcome.</p>
<p>Neutral Review path exists; SLA ≤ 5 business days; representment pack
exports.</p>
<p>Receipts &amp; amended docs reissued automatically; tax/fees
recompute accurately.</p>
<p>Notifications (SFW) and timers implemented (24h/48h/5day); P1 studio
access resolves quickly.</p>
<p>Agent console provides macros, sanctions, deposit tools, and LBG
split outcome.</p>
<p>Telemetry &amp; KPIs instrumented; dashboards track resolution rate,
P1 solve time, chargebacks, and accuracy.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Predictable: Users see outcomes before filing; disputes don’t feel
arbitrary.</p>
<p>Efficient: Autoevidence and policy math drive 70%+ selfserve
resolution.</p>
<p>Chargebackresilient: Every case quietly builds the artifacts needed
to win bank disputes.</p>
<p>Fair &amp; transparent: LBG keeps ledgers separate but summaries
simple; buyer fees and deposits behave exactly as stated in
§3.1/§3.9.</p>
<p>§4.12 — Payments, Payouts &amp; Tax Center UX</p>
<p>Goal: Give buyers, sellers (talent), and studio hosts a clear,
trustworthy money hub: easy payments, transparent fees, predictable
payouts, multistate tax compliance, and clean audit trails—all LBGaware,
policyaccurate, and built to scale across U.S. states.</p>
<p>A) Surfaces &amp; Routes</p>
<p>Billing Home (roleaware): /billing<br />
Snapshot tiles: Upcoming charges, Escrow on hold, Next payout, Tax
status, Promotions wallet.</p>
<p>Payment Methods (buyers): /billing/payment-methods<br />
Cards, ACH, default flag, 3DS history, ACH verification status.</p>
<p>Payouts (sellers/hosts): /billing/payouts<br />
Bank accounts, payout schedule, reserves, Early Payout, ledger &amp;

<p>B) Personas &amp; What They Can Do</p>
<p>Buyer / Brand: add cards/ACH, pick default at checkout, download
receipts &amp; invoices, set cost centers/PO (when enabled), view
chargeback status, manage RFP credit purchases.</p>
<p>Seller (Talent) / Host (Studio): connect bank for payouts, view
payout ledger &amp; statements, enable Early Payout (if eligible), see
fee math per booking, complete W9 and download annual forms.</p>
<p>Dualrole accounts: both tabs visible; payouts combine earnings across
roles and studios but keep perbooking lines separate for audit.</p>
<p>C) Money Model Recap (tooltips/FAQs)</p>
<p>Buyer service fee: 5% per booking (3% with ACH when enabled; min
$3).</p>
<p>Provider fee: 12% of booking subtotal (talent:
packages/addons/license/travel; studio: hourly/cleaning).<br />
Discounts: Instant Book –1%, Trusted Pro –0.5%; highvalue tier: 10% on
portion &gt; $1,000.</p>
<p>Deposits (studios): authorization holds, not GMV; captured only on
approved claims.</p>
<p>Escrow: funds held until Acceptance/Autoaccept (talent) or checkout
complete (studio); then queued for payout.</p>
<p>Early Payout: optional, peruse 0.5% on the provider fee component
only, eligibilitygated (Rep ≥ 85 + ID Verified).</p>
<p>Taxes: destinationbased, computed at checkout per jurisdiction; shown
as a line on receipts.</p>

<p>D) Payment Methods (Buyer)</p>
<p>Add Card<br />
Modal: card details; 3DS prompts when required. Set default; nickname
(e.g., “Marketing Visa”).</p>
<p>Add ACH<br />
Plaidstyle link or microdeposit fallback; ribbon: “ACH reduces buyer fee
to 3%.”<br />
Status: Pending verify • Verified • Expired consent.</p>
<p>Controls<br />
Make default, remove, retry failed method, view 3DS auth log.</p>
<p>Security copy<br />
“We never store your full card number; all data is tokenized by our
PCIcompliant processor.”</p>
<p>E) Checkout Integration (Buyer)</p>
<p>Method selector surfaces saved Card/ACH; ACH badge shows reduced
fee.</p>
<p>If method fails → inline retry, add new method, or switch to
card.</p>
<p>Tax calculation (automated): at review step, we call the tax engine
with role/service, price lines, date/time &amp; service location, buyer
info; engine returns jurisdiction breakdown (state/county/city) and
total tax.</p>
<p>If the transaction is not taxable in that jurisdiction or we’re below
nexus in that state, tax shows $0.00 with “Not applicable” tooltip.</p>
<p>If taxable, tax appears as a separate line with “View tax detail”
(expandable).</p>
<p>For LBG, we compute tax per booking and present group total; deposit
holds listed for Studio (authorization only).</p>

Early Payout (peruse): toggle per payout; shows fee estimate and
eligibility.</p>
<p>Payout Ledger<br />
Table: Date, Payout ID, Amount, Bookings count, Breakdown link.<br />
Breakdown shows: gross, platform fees, tax (for info only), discounts,
adjustments, taxes collected (buyerside), net, Early Payout fee (if
used).<br />

<p>I) Tax Center (USfirst) — Expanded with automation &amp;
compliance</p>
<p>Profiles &amp; Onboarding</p>
<p>W9 collection (electronic): guided web form for U.S.
persons/entities; captures all W9 fields + perjury declaration +
esignature; stores signed form; versioning on updates.</p>
<p>TIN match (soft): background name/TIN validation; surface “Mismatch —
please correct” banner to reduce 1099 errors.</p>
<p>Blocking rule: payouts are blocked until a valid W9 is on file
(prevents backup withholding complexity).</p>
<p>Edelivery consent: toggle &amp; capture consent log for electronic
delivery of yearend forms; fallback to paper mail only if required.</p>
<p>Marketplace Sales Tax (explainer tile)</p>
<p>“We’re required by state marketplace facilitator laws to collect and
remit sales tax on taxable transactions in many states. Taxes are
computed automatically at checkout based on service location and
state/local rules.”</p>
<p>Link: “View where we collect tax” → knowledge base list
(automaintained).</p>
<p>YearEnd Forms (1099)</p>
<p>Thresholdaware messaging: dynamic banners (“On track to receive a
Form 1099NEC this year” or “Below threshold; no form expected”) driven
by current IRS guidance (configurable—no hardcoded amounts).</p>
<p>Automated generation: system compiles annual earnings (gross), uses
stored W9, and generates 1099 forms (efile to IRS + states via provider;
Combined Federal/State Filing where supported).</p>
<p>Delivery: issue PDF in Tax Center (by Jan 31); notify via email/app;
if no edelivery consent or not accessed by a cutoff, trigger paper mail
via provider.</p>
<p>Status chips: Not required • Pending • Issued; download history
retained.</p>
<p>Summaries &amp; Exports</p>
<p>Annual summaries: gross earnings, fees, refunds, adjustments,
reserves (for personal bookkeeping).</p>
<p>Exports: month/quarter CSV of gross, fees, refunds, adjustments,
reserves.</p>
<p>Disclaimers</p>
<p>“We don’t provide tax advice; consult a tax professional.”</p>
<p>J) Chargebacks, Holds &amp; Deposits</p>
<p>Chargebacks (buyerside): show case status &amp; timeline; link to
Support case; note temporary payout holds when applicable.</p>
<p>Seller/Host view: representment status; attached evidence; estimated
decision window.</p>
<p>Deposits (studio): show authorization, expiry, capture/void/release;
deposit capture generates separate receipt (no platform fee).</p>
<p>K) Notifications</p>
<p>Buyer: payment success/failure, ACH verified, refund issued,
chargeback opened/closed.</p>
<p>Seller/Host: bank verified, payout queued/sent/failed, reserve
changes, Early Payout executed, chargeback opened.</p>
<p>Tax: W9 needed, W9 mismatch, edelivery consent needed, yearend form
available.</p>
<p>All notifications are SFW and privacysafe.</p>
<p>L) Security, Privacy &amp; Compliance — Expanded</p>
<p>PCI DSS: handled by processor; we store only tokens.</p>
<p>KYC/KYB: processorhosted flows (name, DOB, EIN, beneficial owners for
entities).</p>
<p>PII minimization: TINs and sensitive tax data encrypted at rest
(fieldlevel), with separate key vault; strict RBAC; admin access
justified and audited.</p>
<p>W9 esignature compliance: electronic W9 flow meets IRS requirements
(capture consent, signature intent, full form fields, tamperevidence,
reproducible PDF).</p>
<p>Edelivery compliance: capture affirmative consent; provide online
access; allow optout; mail paper if consent not given or
undeliverable.</p>
<p>Audit trail: tax engine calls (request/response summaries), tax lines
per receipt, W9 versions, TIN match results (nonsensitive codes), 1099
issuance logs, edelivery view events.</p>
<p>Data retention: retain W9 and 1099 records per federal/state
requirements; purge on schedule after statutory window.</p>
<p>Safe Mode: billing/tax emails never include explicit previews;
receipts show only SFW descriptions.</p>
<p>M) Accessibility &amp; Performance</p>
<p>Keyboardable forms; clear labels; ARIA for steppers/tables;
highcontrast charts.</p>
<p>TTI targets: &lt;2.0s for /billing; paginated tables with skeletons;
exports generated asynchronously with download links.</p>
<p>N) Telemetry (money &amp; tax events)</p>
<p>billing.open</p>
<p>payment_method.add/remove/default • ach.verify.start/success/fail •

<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.12 FINAL)</p>
<p>Billing Home snapshot tiles for upcoming charges, escrow, next
payout, wallet, tax status.</p>
<p>Payment Methods supports Card (3DS) &amp; ACH, default selection, and
checkout integration with ACH fee reduction to 3% (when enabled).</p>
<p>Checkout calls tax engine with role/service, location, and price
lines; returns jurisdiction tax; receipts show tax line with
jurisdiction breakdown; nontaxable or nonnexus cases show $0 with
explanation.</p>
<p>Payouts page supports bank connect, reserve visibility, Early Payout
peruse, ledger &amp; statements with perbooking breakdowns (role vs
studio).</p>
<p>Receipts include single and LBG group formats; support amendments;
deposit authorizations shown distinctly.</p>
<p>Promotions Wallet shows Boost/Featured spend, credits, budgets;
invalid click credits itemized.</p>
<p>Tax Center: electronic W9 collection with esig, TIN match, payout
block until W9; edelivery consent; dynamic threshold banners; 1099
generation &amp; delivery (PDF download; mail fallback); annual
summaries &amp; exports.</p>
<p>Chargebacks &amp; Deposits states visible to both sides; deposit
captures generate separate receipts (no platform fee).</p>
<p>Security/Compliance: TIN encryption at rest, RBAC, audit trails (tax
engine, W9 versions, 1099 issuance), IRScompliant eW9 &amp; edelivery
flows.</p>
<p>Accessibility/Performance targets met; Telemetry events fire as
listed.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Compliant by design: Destinationbased tax with jurisdiction detail +
marketplace facilitator stance removes ambiguity and state risk.</p>
<p>Handsoff tax ops: Automated eW9, TIN match, and 1099
generation/edelivery put tax handling on autopilot with clear UX.</p>
<p>Transparent &amp; trustworthy: Every receipt shows tax lines and
calculations; users can download forms and summaries easily.</p>
<p>Scales with us: Citybycity growth doesn’t require rearchitecting
money/tax flows; we add states, not complexity.</p>
<p>§4.13 — Verification Center UX</p>
<p>Goal: Make verification fast, private, and explainable—so good actors
unlock trust and distribution quickly, while risky behavior is filtered
early. Centralize all checks in one Verification Center, with clear
benefits, transparent progress, firm privacy controls, and compliant
workflows (ID, background, social metrics, studio).</p>
<p>A) Surfaces &amp; Routes</p>
<p>Verification Center home: /verify (also topnav “Verify” badge if
incomplete).</p>
<p>Contextual nudges: in profile editor, Checkout (Instant Book gating),
Boost setup, Studio onboarding.</p>
<p>Admin console (Trust): /admin/verify queue with evidence, statuses,
audits.</p>
<p>B) Verification Types &amp; Badges (what users can earn)</p>
<p>ID Verified (Person) — government ID + selfie liveness; unlocks
Instant Book, +20 DM credits, storage bump (to 30 GB), Verifiedonly
search filter eligibility.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro (Backgroundchecked) — FCRAstyle consumer report; unlocks
–0.5% provider fee nudge (floor rules apply), Boost eligibility, search
nudge, storage bump to 50 GB.</p>
<p>SocialVerified — connected IG/YT/TT/X with API metrics; enables
verified chips and perplatform filters in search (§1.2 addendum).</p>
<p>Studio Verified (Space) — proof of control (lease/utility/biz doc) +
address validation + photos; shows Studio Verified badge and filter.</p>
<p>Phone &amp; Email Verified — base checks (SMS/OTP, email link) always
required for outbound messaging.</p>
<p>Optional Safety Aware (Phase 2) — short safety module + quiz; soft
search nudge.</p>
<p>18+ only: All roles require dateofbirth confirmation; ID flow
enforces 18+.</p>
<p>C) Benefits, Gating &amp; Incentives (consistent with §§1.5, 3.2,
3.3)</p>
<p>ID Verified: Instant Book on, +20 DM credits/month, storage 30 GB,
“Verifiedonly” buyer filter, mild ranking tiebreak.</p>
<p>Trusted Pro: fee nudge –0.5%, Boost eligibility, priority in RFP
queues, storage 50 GB.</p>
<p>SocialVerified: metric chips on cards/profile; eligibility for “Top
in Houston” showcases.</p>
<p>Studio Verified: appears in “Verified Studios” selector at checkout;
eligibility for Featured Studio carousel.</p>
<p>Boost eligibility: requires ID Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no strikes
(§3.3).</p>
<p>Founding city subsidies: autoapplied coupon for first N completions
per city (configurable; see §3.4).</p>
<p>D) Person — ID Verification Flow</p>
<p>Route: /verify/id → 4step wizard</p>
<p>About you — legal name, DOB, country/state; explain “Your public
profile can use an alias; legal name is private.”</p>
<p>Document capture — front/back (DL/ID/Passport); autoOCR; MRZ when
available.</p>
<p>Selfie liveness — short movement prompts; face match score presented
as “passed/needs review.”</p>
<p>Review &amp; consent — purpose, retention policy, and submit.</p>
<p>UX states:</p>
<p>Instant result: Passed → badge applied immediately.</p>
<p>Needs review: manual review SLA ≤ 24 h; user can continue using
platform; IB remains gated until pass.</p>
<p>Fail: give concrete next steps (better lighting, correct doc type)
and allow 2 more attempts before manual review.</p>
<p>Privacy: Store only required vectors/metadata; no raw images shown to
other users; legal name never public unless user opts in.</p>
<p>E) Person — Background Check (Trusted Pro)</p>
<p>Route: /verify/background → compliant consent flow</p>
<p>Consent &amp; disclosure: explain scope; this is not employment, but
we follow FCRAstyle notices.</p>
<p>PII capture: SSN (masked in UI), address history (5 years), legal
name variations.</p>
<p>Run checks: national/criminal sex offender, relevant county/state,
global sanctions (where legal), identity verification.</p>

<p>Adverse action (riskmanaged):</p>
<p>Preadverse notice with report copy &amp; dispute instructions.</p>
<p>7day response window (configurable); investigation pause.</p>
<p>Final decision recorded; detailed internal notes; user notified.</p>
<p>Policy highlights:</p>
<p>Disqualifying offenses scoped to platform safety (e.g., violent
crimes, stalking, trafficking).</p>
<p>Recency &amp; rehabilitation considered (timeweighted);
expunged/sealed records ignored where required.</p>
<p>Recheck cadence: every 12 months or upon safety trigger.</p>
<p>Cost: passthrough pricing with foundingcity subsidies (§3.4); status
shows any coupon applied.</p>
<p>F) Social Verification (metrics &amp; badges)</p>
<p>Route: /verify/social</p>
<p>Connect Instagram/YouTube/TikTok/X via OAuth; request readonly
insights scopes; display exactly what we fetch.</p>
<p>Verified chips appear on profile/search cards (e.g., IG 182k • 2.8%
ER, “Verified via API”).</p>
<p>Sync: nightly + manual refresh up to 3×/day (ratelimited); handles
token expiry gracefully.</p>
<p>Unlink: allowed; metrics fall back to selfreported (hidden by default
unless buyer toggles “include selfreported”).</p>
<p>Manual verify path for large accounts if API unavailable (proof post,
domain verification, lightweight review).</p>
<p>FanSubscription Creators: supported as Creators; no explicit content
ingested; we verify the business account identity/metrics only (Safe
Mode).</p>
<p>G) Studio Verification (space owners/hosts)</p>
<p>Route: /verify/studio/{studioId}</p>
<p>Ownership/control proof — upload lease/utility/biz registration,
names must reasonably match host profile or company.</p>

stays private until booking confirmation.</p>
<p>Space evidence — frontage photo + interior set (SFW) + entrance
signage; EXIF timestamp hints accepted.</p>
<p>Rules &amp; safety — hazards toggles, House Rules review, emergency
contact.</p>
<p>Review &amp; badge — “Studio Verified” with verification date;
reverify every 12 months or on change.</p>
<p>What buyers see: Studio Verified badge, neighborhood (not exact
address), rules summary.</p>
<p>H) Security &amp; Safety Addons</p>
<p>Phone/email verified (required); 2FA optional (strongly recommended
for payout changes).</p>
<p>Trusted Contact (optional): can receive checkin/out timestamps and
generalarea location on active bookings.</p>
<p>Emergency PIN (Phase 2): inapp PIN sends silent alert to Safety with
live thread + booking IDs.</p>
<p>Device trust (Phase 2): flag new devices; email confirmation for
highrisk actions.</p>
<p>I) Privacy, Data Minimization &amp; User Controls</p>
<p>Data we keep (minimum): doc type, issuing country, last 4 of ID,
pass/fail tokens, facematch score bucket, verification timestamps.</p>
<p>What we don’t keep: full ID number image beyond retention window;
live selfie video frames; background raw data beyond provider access
window.</p>
<p>Retention: ID/Studio artifacts ≤ 30–90 days postdecision
(configurable); outcome + reference kept longer for audit.</p>
<p>Download my data: provide verification outcomes and submitted
documents (where lawful) upon request.</p>
<p>Alias vs legal: users may display an alias; legal name stays private
except on tax/legal docs.</p>
<p>J) Admin Console (Trust) &amp; Risk Engine</p>
<p>Queue: ID/Studio/Background/Social with SLA badges; prioritize “needs
review,” highvalue sellers, foundingcity cohorts.</p>
<p>Detail view: sidebyside evidence, vendor decisions, facematch score,
doc OCR fields, address geocode, rule acceptance logs.</p>
<p>Actions: approve/deny/require resubmission; redact PII; add internal
notes; trigger recheck; apply sanctions (IB off, Boost suppression).</p>
<p>Audit: immutable logs (who/when/what changed), reason codes, document
hashes.</p>
<p>Risk signals: velocity of failed attempts, device mismatch,
suspicious patterns → safety investigation flag.</p>
<p>K) Notifications &amp; Status</p>
<p>ID: Submitted → Passed / Needs review / Action required.</p>
<p>Background: In progress → Clear / Review / Consider; Preadverse +
Adverse notices with next steps.</p>
<p>Social: Connected → Verified metrics available; token expired →
Reconnect.</p>
<p>Studio: Under review → Verified / Action required; reverify reminders
at 11 months.</p>
<p>System nudges: “Unlock Instant Book with ID,” “Get Trusted Pro for
fee nudge and Boosts,” “Verify studio to appear in Verified
selector.”</p>
<p>L) Accessibility &amp; Performance</p>
<p>All flows keyboardable; large tap targets on mobile capture; clear
alt text for instructions.</p>
<p>Use progress steppers, skeleton loaders; show typical decision times
(e.g., “Most ID checks &lt; 2 min”) as informative copy.</p>
<p>Support lowbandwidth: allow photo upload from gallery if live capture
fails.</p>
<p>M) Telemetry</p>
<p>verify.center.open</p>

<p>N) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.13 FINAL)</p>
<p>Verification Center hub live at /verify, showing progress bars,
benefits, and next steps by type.</p>
<p>ID Verification: document + selfie liveness, instant decision or 24h
manual review; 18+ enforced; alias support; privacy copy present.</p>
<p>Background Check (Trusted Pro): consented, FCRAstyle notices,
clear/review/consider outcomes, preadverse/adverse workflow with 7day
window; annual recheck; fee surfaced; subsidies supported.</p>
<p>Social Verification: OAuth for IG/YT/TT/X, nightly sync + manual
refresh (3/day), verified chips in search/profile, safemode handling for
FanSub creators.</p>
<p>Studio Verification: ownership proof, address validation, photo
evidence, rules; badge on approval; reverify cadence; partial address
privacy.</p>
<p>Gating &amp; incentives wired: Instant Book requires ID Verified;
Boost eligibility requires Trusted Pro + Rep ≥ 70; storage bumps (30 GB
/ 50 GB); DM credit increases; fee nudge –0.5% for Trusted Pro.</p>
<p>Admin console with queue, actions, audits, sanctions, and risk flags;
immutable logs.</p>
<p>Privacy &amp; retention: PII minimization, encryption at rest,
retention windows, downloadmydata.</p>
<p>Notifications and nudge campaigns implemented;
Accessibility/Performance baselines met; Telemetry events firing.</p>
<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Low friction, high signal: Users see exactly why to verify and what
they get—conversiondriving perks rather than busywork.</p>
<p>Safety you can feel: Clear standards, FCRAstyle fairness, and
privacybydesign build trust with models/creators and buyers.</p>
<p>Search quality improves: Verified supply rises to the top without
“paytowin”; risk is filtered before bookings.</p>
<p>Operates at scale: Vendorbacked checks, admin SLAs, audits, and
recheck cadence keep trust programs healthy citybycity.</p>
<p>§4.14.1 — Access Governance &amp; Security</p>
<p>Goal: Ensure admins can do their jobs safely, quickly, and
accountably. Enforce leastprivilege, protect PII, require explicit
justification for sensitive actions, and make every change auditable and
alertable.</p>
<p>A) Principles</p>
<p>Least privilege by default — roles get only what they need.</p>
<p>PII is special — tax/identity data behind extra gates; mask by
default.</p>
<p>Justintime elevation — timeboxed, reasoned elevation for highrisk
actions.</p>
<p>Twoperson rule — critical money/safety moves require a second
approver.</p>
<p>Full traceability — immutable audit for who/what/why/when, with
diffs.</p>
<p>Separation of duties — no single role can initiate and approve the
same highrisk change.</p>
<p>Environment clarity — bright “Sandbox/Prod” labeling; no
crosscontamination.</p>
<p>B) Roles &amp; Permission Scopes (RBAC)</p>
<p>Roles (no nesting; combine if needed):</p>
<p>Super Admin (restricted to founders/CTO): feature flags, configs,
emergency kills.</p>
<p>Trust &amp; Safety: verifications, sanctions, strikes, IB toggle,
content quarantine.</p>
<p>Support: tickets/disputes, policybound refunds (within caps), message
redaction.</p>
<p>Finance: payouts/reserves, manual adjustments (with twoperson
approval), chargebacks, coupons.</p>
<p>Tax &amp; Compliance: W9/TIN dashboard, 1099 runs, nexus map
overrides (dualapproval).</p>
<p>Content: reviews/profile/feed moderation, keyword lists, SafeMode
thresholds (preview only).</p>
<p>Ops (City/Market): promos, CPC floors, Featured slots, foundingcity
perks.</p>
<p>Marketing: homepage modules, email templates, coupon creation (no
money moves).</p>
<p>ReadOnly Auditor: dashboards/exports; masked PII; no changes.</p>
<p>Permission scopes:</p>
<p>PIIBasic: email, phone (masked by default; unmask requires
reason).</p>
<p>PIISensitive: address, DOB (unmask gate).</p>
<p>PIITax: TIN, W9 PDFs, 1099 (Tax role only; dualapproval to
unmask).</p>
<p>PIIBackground: consumer report artifacts (Trust only; FCRA training
required).</p>
<p>MoneyCritical: manual payout, fee override, deposit capture &gt;$1k
(twoperson rule).</p>
<p>SafetyCritical: IB suppression, account hold (reason &amp; SLA
tag).</p>
<p>C) Login, Session &amp; Device Controls</p>
<p>SSO (admin): enforce SSO (e.g., Okta/Google), 2FA required (TOTP or
hardware key).</p>
<p>IP/Geo rules (optional): block risky geos; allow admin office
IPs.</p>
<p>Session policy: 12hour max; 15minute idle timeout; reauth for
sensitive actions.</p>
<p>Device trust: label devices; new device prompts email
confirmation.</p>
<p>Environment banner: persistent “PROD”/“SANDBOX” badge with color
coding.</p>
<p>D) JustinTime Elevation &amp; TwoPerson Approvals</p>
<p>JIT elevation: click “Request elevation” → select scope (e.g.,
MoneyCritical), add reason + ticket link → manager/peer approves →
30–120 min token granted → autorevoke and log.</p>
<p>Twoperson rule: actions requiring cosign (examples):</p>
<p>Manual payout, fee override, deposit capture &gt;$1k, tax nexus
overrides, adverse action finalization (background), permanent account
disable.</p>
<p>UI shows “Awaiting cosign” chip; approver sees payload diff before
confirming.</p>
<p>E) PII Handling &amp; Redaction</p>
<p>Masked by default: show •••• for sensitive fields; “Unmask (reason)”
button with scope check.</p>
<p>Download controls: exporting tables with PII requires scope +
download reason; big red banner with “Contains PII.”</p>
<p>Inline redaction: Support/Content can redact userposted PII from
threads/reviews (stores original hashed reference; shows “Redacted
(Support)” tag).</p>
<p>PII view ledger: who accessed what PII, when, and why; exportable for
audits.</p>
<p>F) Impersonation vs. ViewAs</p>
<p>ViewAs (safe default): renders the UI with PII masked; no write
actions; used for reproducing UI issues.</p>
<p>Impersonate (restricted): requires JIT elevation + reason; write
actions allowed, but money moves disabled in impersonation; session
banner “IMPERSONATING {user}”; all actions doublelogged (actor +
target).</p>
<p>Guardrails: cannot impersonate Super Admins; timeboxed; logs include
IP/device.</p>
<p>G) Audit &amp; Change History</p>
<p>Immutable audit log capturing: actor, role, IP/device, route, entity
IDs, before/after diff, reason code, linked ticket/case.</p>
<p>Entity Timelines: on users, bookings, payouts, disputes, promotions:
chronological stack of admin/user/system events.</p>
<p>Searchable audits: by actor, entity, reason, time range; export to
CSV/PDF; retention policies applied.</p>
<p>Legal hold: mark entities to suspend purge (links to §4.14.15).</p>
<p>H) Admin UI Patterns (Safety by Design)</p>
<p>Action drawers with required reason, preview of impact, and secondary
confirmation for risky moves.</p>
<p>Risk badges (P0/P1/P2) appear on threads/safety cases; timers
visible.</p>
<p>Kill switches (flagged in §4.14.2): big, red, twostep with summary
(what services will pause, who’s impacted).</p>
<p>Environmentaware copy: SANDBOX disallows emails/payouts; “simulation
only” labels.</p>
<p>I) Alerts &amp; Anomaly Detection</p>
<p>Highrisk action alerts to Slack/email: manual payouts, deposit
captures, fee overrides, permanent disables, tax overrides.</p>
<p>Anomaly monitors:</p>
<p>“TIN views by a single admin &gt; N/day”</p>
<p>“Refunds issued &gt; $X in 1h”</p>
<p>“IB suppressions &gt; Y/day by same actor”</p>
<p>“Mass role changes”</p>
<p>Daily digest: PII views, highrisk actions, failed JIT requests; link
to audits.</p>
<p>J) Telemetry (Admin Access Events)</p>
<p>admin.login.success/fail (role) • admin.session.timeout •
admin.device.trust.add</p>
<p>admin.elevate.request/approve/deny/expire (scope, reason)</p>
<p>admin.twoperson.request/approve/deny (action)</p>
<p>admin.pii.unmask (field, reason) • admin.export.download (scope)</p>
<p>admin.viewas.start/end • admin.impersonate.start/end</p>
<p>admin.alert.sent (type) • admin.anomaly.detected (rule_id)</p>
<p>audit.view (filters) • audit.export</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.1 FINAL)</p>
<p>SSO + mandatory 2FA for all admin roles; session/timeouts enforced;
environment banner shows clearly.</p>
<p>RBAC roles &amp; scopes implemented; sensitive scopes (PIITax,
PIIBackground, MoneyCritical, SafetyCritical) enforced at API and
UI.</p>
<p>JIT elevation with reason and approver; timeboxed tokens; logs
captured.</p>
<p>Twoperson approval on manual payouts, fee overrides, deposit capture
&gt;$1k, tax nexus overrides, final adverse actions.</p>
<p>PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason; PII access
ledger visible and exportable.</p>
<p>ViewAs (readonly, masked) vs Impersonate (restricted, no money moves)
implemented with banners and dual logging.</p>
<p>Immutable audit with before/after diffs on entities; searchable and
exportable; legal hold flag present.</p>
<p>Alerts &amp; anomaly rules active; Slack/email wiring; daily digest
generated.</p>
<p>UI safety patterns: action drawers require reasons; confirmations for
risky actions; killswitch pattern in §4.14.2.</p>
<p>Telemetry events fire for all listed actions.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Prevents accidental harm (leastprivilege, masked defaults,
confirmations).</p>
<p>Stops malicious misuse (JIT + twoperson rule + anomaly alerts +
immutable audits).</p>
<p>Speeds legit work (viewas to debug safely; impersonation gated for
rare cases).</p>
<p>Regulatoryfriendly (PII access ledger, legal holds, full diffs).</p>
<p>§4.14.2 — Config &amp; Feature Flags</p>
<p>Goal: Give Ops the nocode levers to launch, tune, and safeguard the
marketplace citybycity and rolebyrole. Ship a typed Config Registry,
targeted Feature Flags, safe rollouts/rollbacks, and guardrails so the
team can change policy, pricing, ranking, promos, and safety without
deployments.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Principles</p>
<p>Single source of truth: a versioned, typed registry consumed by all
services (search, booking, billing, trust, promos).</p>
<p>Targeted overrides: global &lt; US &lt; state &lt; city &lt; role
&lt; cohort (most specific wins).</p>
<p>Safety rails: validation, min/max bounds, twoperson approvals for
money/safety keys.</p>
<p>Observable: every read/write logged; diffs, rollbacks, and
blastradius previews.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; reversible: staged rollouts, scheduled publishes, oneclick
revert.</p>
<p>Auditfirst: immutable history with actor, reason, before/after.</p>
<p>B) Config Registry (model &amp; precedence)</p>
<p>Entity: config_set</p>
<p>Keys: namespaced (fees.provider_pct, refunds.talent.bands,
search.weights.rep …).</p>
<p>Value types: boolean, int, float, money, string, enum, json (schema
enforced).</p>
<p>Scope: global|US|state|city|role|cohort (compound scopes allowed,
e.g., city=HOU,role=studio).</p>
<p>Versioning: semantic increment; store diffs and publish notes.</p>
<p>Validation: schema + business rules (e.g., fees.provider_pct &gt;=
0.09).</p>
<p>Precedence: mostspecific scope overrides broader scopes; unresolved
keys inherit.</p>
<p>Workflows</p>
<p>Draft → Validate → Preview → Approve (2person for sensitive) →
Schedule/Publish → Monitor → Rollback.</p>
<p>Preview: simulate impact on last N searches/bookings; show KPI
guardrails.</p>
<p>Rollback: pick prior version; instant invalidate caches; autonotify
services.</p>
<p>C) Feature Flags (targeting &amp; kill switches)</p>
<p>Flag types: boolean (on/off), percentage (staged rollout), variant
(A/B), targeting (by scope/attribute).</p>
<p>Targeting: by city, state, role, cohort, rep_score, verified,
trusted_pro, ab_cell.</p>
<p>Kill switches (hard off with graceful fallbacks):</p>
<p>flags.instant_book.enabled</p>
<p>flags.promotions.boosts.enabled /
flags.promotions.featured.enabled</p>
<p>flags.ach.enabled (fallback to card; buyer fee reverts to 5%)</p>
<p>flags.studio.deposits.enabled</p>
<p>flags.safe_mode.enabled (enforce strict previews)</p>
<p>flags.lbg.enabled (Linked Booking Group off → separate flows)</p>

}</p>
<p>E) Rollouts, Scheduling &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Staged rollout: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% (by city/role/cohort);
automonitor KPIs (dropdown presets).</p>
<p>Scheduling: publish windows (start/end), local timezone
awareness.</p>
<p>Guardrails: block publish if validations fail (e.g., provider fee
&lt; floor) or if simulated KPI deltas exceed thresholds (e.g., est.
takerate −&gt; −3%+).</p>
<p>Rollback: oneclick revert; auto cachebust; notify affected modules
(webhooks).</p>
<p>Approvals: twoperson approval required for fees, promo pricing, tax
category map, nexus list, NSFW visibility.</p>
<p>Dryrun: compute outcomes (no apply) for 24h; log deltas to admin
dashboard.</p>
<p>F) Admin UI (Editor)</p>
<p>Form + JSON dual view; live validation; inline hints; example
payloads.</p>
<p>Diff viewer (before/after) with reason code &amp; ticket link.</p>
<p>Impact preview: sample searches/rankings, bookingfee math, promo
inventory fill.</p>
<p>Scope picker: breadcrumb of inheritances; “show effective value” at
any scope.</p>
<p>History &amp; rollback: timeline of publishes; pin “golden”
configs.</p>
<p>G) Service Consumption &amp; Caching</p>
<p>Read path: services request effective_config(scope, key); library
resolves precedence + local cache.</p>
<p>Caching: inmemory TTL + eventdriven invalidation (pub/sub); 99p read
latency &lt; 5ms.</p>
<p>Bootsafe: services start with last known snapshot; failopen defaults
for noncritical keys; failclosed for safety/money keys.</p>
<p>Schema shared package to avoid drift; CI blocks breaking changes.</p>
<p>H) Observability &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>Config read metrics: hit/miss, stale fetch, latency; perservice
dashboards.</p>
<p>Drift detection: compare service snapshot vs registry head; alert on
mismatch.</p>
<p>Anomaly rules:</p>
<p>“Fee change &gt; 1% absolute in 24h across &gt;2 cities”</p>
<p>“NSFW visibility toggled in Safe Mode city”</p>
<p>“CPC floors moved &gt; $0.20 in 1h”</p>
<p>Slack/email alerts on publish/rollback for sensitive domains.</p>
<p>I) Telemetry (config events)</p>
<p>config.edit.start/validate/fail/success</p>
<p>config.preview.run/result (KPI deltas)</p>
<p>config.publish.request/approve/deny</p>
<p>config.publish.start/done/rollback</p>
<p>config.read (service, scope, key) • config.cache.invalidate</p>
<p>flags.toggle (name, targeting, % rollout)</p>
<p>J) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.2 FINAL)</p>
<p>Typed Config Registry with scopes, precedence, validation,
versioning, and immutable history.</p>
<p>Feature Flags with targeting, staged rollout, and kill switches wired
to fallbacks.</p>
<p>Editable keys implemented for Fees, Refunds/Delivery, Travel,
Search/Ranking/Safe Mode, Promotions, Verification/Rep,
Support/Disputes, Tax, Messaging/Storage, Studios, City Perks.</p>
<p>Twoperson approvals enforced for sensitive keys; guardrails prevent
outofbounds settings.</p>
<p>Preview &amp; simulation tools display impact on recent
searches/bookings; KPI thresholds gate publishes.</p>
<p>Scheduling &amp; rollback operational; cache invalidation with
pub/sub; service snapshots bootsafe.</p>
<p>Observability dashboards + alerts for config publishes, drift, and
anomalies.</p>
<p>Telemetry events fired for edits, previews, publishes, reads, and
rollbacks.</p>
<p>K) Example Playbooks (no code required)</p>
<p>Houston buyerfee holiday: set fees.buyer_pct=0.00 for city=HOU with
end date → publish staged → autorevert.</p>
<p>Tighten Safe Mode: raise classifier.threshold.preview to 0.85 for
state=TX after a spike; rollback if CTR drops &gt;5%.</p>
<p>Add travel fee band: append 25–50mi at $60 for city=DAL; preview
geosim; publish.</p>
<p>Ranking tune: bump search.weights.rep_tiebreak from 1.0→1.2 in
HOU:model; A/B 50/50; evaluate conversion.</p>
<p>Deposit policy update: increase studio.deposit.cap_money to $400 for
LA; schedule for tomorrow 09:00 local; rollback link armed.</p>
<p>Boost economics: lift promos.boosts.cpc_floor.city_role["HOU:model"]
to $1.00; monitor ROAS; revert if invalid clicks &gt;7%.</p>
<p>§4.14.3 — Trust &amp; Safety Ops</p>
<p>Goal: Prevent harm, respond fast, and preserve marketplace integrity.
Provide Ops with clear triage, evidencedriven decisions, proportionate
sanctions, and auditable outcomes—while protecting user privacy and
complying with policy and law.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Inputs</p>
<p>What flows in:</p>
<p>Safety reports (from chat, booking, profile, studio)</p>
<p>Automated risk signals (rate limits, device anomalies, classifier
flags)</p>
<p>Verification results (ID, Background, Social, Studio)</p>
<p>Content flags (handoff to §4.14.4 for final content actions)</p>
<p>Dispute escalations with safety context (handoff from §4.14.5)</p>
<p>Case types (examples):</p>
<p>P0: Imminent harm, threats, stalking, underduress, doxxing, sexual
coercion, child safety.</p>
<p>P1: Onprem access failures, harassment, boundary violations, unsafe
location, escorting/illegal solicitation.</p>
<p>P2: Misrepresentation (age/identity/portfolio), spam/scams,
offplatform payment steering, policy nudity violations (previews).</p>
<p>B) SLAs &amp; Queues</p>
<p>P0 queue: 15 min first response, 60 min mitigation target (freeze,
contact, takedown).</p>
<p>P1 queue: 30 min first response, 24 h resolution target.</p>
<p>P2 queue: 24 h first response, 72 h resolution target.</p>
<p>Queue view includes: severity chip, time since opened, linked
booking/thread, user roles, location (city), verification badges, prior
strikes, and live status (e.g., “IB suppressed,” “payouts frozen”).</p>
<p>C) Triage &amp; Intake (Agent Playbook)</p>
<p>Verify severity (P0/P1/P2) from report details; upgrade severity if
signals suggest escalation.</p>
<p>Is there an active/linked booking? Pull: SOW/House Rules, checkin/out
timestamps, areashare logs, studio rules, delivery manifest.</p>
<p>Preserve evidence (oneclick): chat transcripts, attachments,
IP/device, booking metadata, profile revisions → writeonce storage with
hash (chainofcustody).</p>
<p>Immediate controls (if needed):</p>
<p>Payout freeze (partial) on involved bookings.</p>
<p>IB suppression on reported party (auto for P0).</p>
<p>DM ratelimit for suspected spam.</p>
<p>Profile quarantine (search hidden) pending review.</p>
<p>Contact counterparties via case thread (templated, safe
language).</p>
<p>Decide: resolve, sanction, or escalate to Neutral Review Panel
(multiagent decision) for ambiguous, highimpact cases.</p>
<p>D) Evidence: What Good Looks Like</p>
<p>System logs: booking creation/acceptance, checkin/out, location fuzz
logs, deliverables acceptance, payment attempts (incl. offplatform
keywords).</p>
<p>Conversations: timestamped chat, read receipts, media (with original
metadata), message redactions visible in audit.</p>
<p>Studio artifacts: house rules, access codes, deposit photos/evidence,
door logs if provided.</p>
<p>Verification: ID/Background outcomes, studio proofs, social connect
status.</p>
<p>User history: cancellations/noshows, prior strikes, dispute outcomes,
responsetime stats.</p>
<p>Agent tooling: sidebyside view, sensitive PII masked by default;
“Unmask (reason)” gated by §4.14.1 scopes.</p>
<p>E) Sanctions &amp; Remedies (Proportionate Ladder)</p>
<p>Soft controls:</p>
<p>Education notice (policy excerpt + safer alternative).</p>
<p>DM throttling (reduced newconversation credits for 7–30 days).</p>
<p>IB off for N days (auto for P1/P2; indefinite for P0 until
cleared).</p>
<p>Boost suppression (removes promoted eligibility temporarily).</p>
<p>Strikes (expire after N days unless renewed):</p>
<p>Strike1 (30 days): visible internally; mild ranking dampening.</p>
<p>Strike2 (90 days): IB off, search demotion, promotions blocked.</p>
<p>Strike3 (180 days): account hold or suspension; payout freezes
resolved per policy.</p>
<p>Hard outcomes:</p>
<p>Account suspension (reversible with review)</p>
<p>Permanent disable (twoperson approval; limited to egregious or
repeated harm)</p>
<p>Studio delisting (Studio Verified badge revoked)</p>
<p>Law enforcement referral (via §4.14.15 workflow)</p>
<p>Autosanction triggers (configurable in §4.14.2):</p>
<p>≥2 P1 cases in 90 days → auto Strike2</p>
<p>Any P0 credible harm → Strike3 + suspension</p>
<p>Repeated offplatform payment attempts after warnings → IB off + DM
throttle</p>
<p>F) Risk Rules Engine (ConfigDriven)</p>
<p>Signals: newaccount velocity, message spam patterns, offplatform
payment phrases, device mismatch, sudden rating bursts, selfclick
promos, NSFW keyword hits.</p>
<p>Actions: autothrottle DMs, quarantine profile, flag to T&amp;S queue,
suppress IB, block Boosts, require reverify.</p>
<p>Explainability: every auto action records rule_id, inputs, and
confidence; surfaced in case panel; tunable via §4.14.2
(weights/thresholds).</p>
<p>Failures safe: false positives decay; manual override clears the flag
and adds rule feedback.</p>
<p>G) Background &amp; Identity (Link to §4.13)</p>
<p>Background “Consider/Review” → T&amp;S evaluates role fit, recency,
rehabilitation; adverse action flow (preadverse notice, 7day
response).</p>
<p>Underage concerns: immediate suspension, ID reverify, documentation
gate; report via child safety playbook if credible.</p>
<p>Impersonation/catfish: require live selfie/ID recheck; quarantine
portfolio; strike if intent to defraud.</p>
<p>H) StudioSpecific Safety</p>
<p>Access failure (P1): verify instructions sent, code validity; if
failure owed to host → refund policy path + deposit void; if guest
misconduct → partial capture per rules.</p>
<p>Unsafe conditions: hazards misrepresented → Strike &amp; delist until
corrected; require updated photos.</p>
<p>Thirdparty conflicts: landlord complaints or neighbor incidents →
temporary delist; require documentation.</p>
<p>I) Buyer &amp; Provider Protections (Immediate Mitigations)</p>
<p>Trusted Contact ping (if enabled) for delayed checkout / SOS
keywords.</p>
<p>Relocation: for studio lockout, offer curated alternates (Houston
list) + goodwill credit (config limits in §4.14.2).</p>
<p>Emergency path: surface “Get help now” → safety card
(nonlawenforcement resources) + prompt to contact 911 for imminent
danger (we don’t intercept emergencies).</p>
<p>J) Appeals &amp; Neutral Review</p>
<p>Appeal window: 14 days from sanction; one appeal per case unless new
evidence.</p>
<p>Neutral Review Panel: 2 T&amp;S agents + 1 crossfunction
(Support/Legal); majority rule; document rationale.</p>
<p>Outcome: uphold, downgrade sanction, or overturn; update strike count
and Reputation (§4.10).</p>
<p>Transparency: user receives outcome with policy citations; internal
notes logged.</p>
<p>K) Integrations &amp; Handoffs</p>
<p>Content: NSFW/preview violations routed to §4.14.4 with case linkage;
content removal reasons synchronized.</p>
<p>Support/Disputes: safetycolored disputes use this case ID; refund
calculators reflect sanctions/policy.</p>
<p>Finance: payout freeze flags; chargeback evidence packs pull T&amp;S
evidence.</p>
<p>Legal &amp; Records: LE requests, subpoenas, child safety referrals
via §4.14.15 with limited PII access.</p>
<p>L) Metrics &amp; Quality</p>
<p>Operational KPIs</p>
<p>P0/P1 firstresponse SLA hit rate</p>
<p>Time to mitigation (P0 median ≤ 60m)</p>
<p>Safety incident rate per 1,000 bookings (target downward trend)</p>
<p>False positive rate (autosanctions)</p>
<p>Appeal overturn rate (target &lt; 10%)</p>
<p>Repeat offender rate (strike recurrence within 180 days)</p>
<p>IB suppression count &amp; duration (monitor collateral impact)</p>
<p>Quality controls</p>
<p>Weekly case sampling; peer QA rubric; calibration sessions.</p>
<p>Rule feedback loop: promote/demote rules based on accuracy.</p>
<p>M) Admin UI — Trust Console (Key Interactions)</p>
<p>Case detail: timeline, linked entities, evidence panel, sanctions
drawer with reason codes, strike history.</p>
<p>Oneclick controls: IB off/on, DM throttle, Boost suppression, payout
freeze toggle (with reason).</p>
<p>Evidence pack builder: export ZIP/PDF for chargebacks or legal
(hashed manifest).</p>
<p>Policy helper: inline matrix preview (refund/cancellation) based on

<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.3 FINAL)</p>
<p>Queues &amp; SLAs for P0/P1/P2 with severity chips and timers.</p>
<p>Triage workflow with evidence preservation (hashed), booking/thread
linkage, and immediate controls.</p>
<p>Sanctions ladder implemented (education → throttles → strikes →
suspension/disable) with expiries and autotriggers.</p>
<p>Risk rules engine active; configurable thresholds/weights via
§4.14.2; explainable rule hits.</p>
<p>Background/ID links honored; adverse action flow for background
checks.</p>
<p>Studio safety flows: access failure, unsafe conditions,
delist/reverify.</p>
<p>Appeals &amp; Neutral Review process with documented outcomes and
updates to Reputation.</p>
<p>Integrations to Content, Support/Disputes, Finance, and Legal; payout
freeze flags honored.</p>
<p>Trust Console UI supports oneclick controls, evidence packs, and
policy helper.</p>
<p>Metrics &amp; QA dashboards live; Telemetry events fire as
listed.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Fast where it matters (P0/P1 timers, oneclick mitigations) and fair
where it’s complex (evidence, neutral review, expiring strikes).</p>
<p>Prevention + response: a configurable rule engine reduces incidents;
strong playbooks resolve the rest.</p>
<p>Auditable endtoend: preserved evidence, hashed manifests, reasoned
decisions, and measured quality.</p>
<p>§4.14.4 — Content Moderation</p>
<p>Goal: Keep the platform SFW by default, protect users from harmful or
deceptive content, and maintain highquality discovery. Combine automated
screening, human review, clear policies, and appeals—with auditable
outcomes and city/role tunability via §4.14.2.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Content Types</p>
<p>Moderated surfaces</p>
<p>Profiles (avatar, cover, bio), Service Profiles (per role), Portfolio
(images/videos), Feed posts, Reviews &amp; responses, Studio pages
(photos, amenities), RFP briefs (buyer text), Gig listings/cards (search
cards, ribbons).</p>
<p>Not public but scanned</p>
<p>DM attachments (virus only; policy checks on reported threads),
Deliverables manifests (names/sizes/hash only), House Rules/SOW text
(for prohibited clauses).</p>
<p>Policy anchors (SFW)</p>
<p>Allowed: artistic, nonsexual imagery; fashion/fitness/glamour;
implied nudity that remains SFW in previews.</p>
<p>Prohibited: explicit sexual content; pornographic poses; fetish
content; solicitation of sexual services; child/younglooking sexualized
content; hateful symbols; doxxing/PII in public fields; offplatform
payment steering.</p>
<p>OnlyFans / Fansubscription creators: supported as “Creators”, but no
explicit content is uploaded or displayed; metrics/identity only (per
§4.13).</p>
<p>B) Pipeline Overview (Upload → Screen → Publish)</p>
<p>Upload → temporary pending state (placeholders with skeletons).</p>
<p>Automated screening (subsecond):</p>
<p>NSFW classifier (preview threshold from §4.14.2
classifier.threshold.preview).</p>
<p>Nudity mask: detects areola/genital zones; triggers autocrop/blur
overlay tool.</p>
<p>OCR for embedded PII (emails, phone #, payment handles).</p>
<p>Text filters on titles/captions/hashtags (slurs, sexual solicitation,
offplatform payment phrases).</p>
<p>Duplicate/perceptual hash check (copyright/banlist).</p>
<p>Virus/malware scan (for videos).</p>
<p>Policy decision:</p>
<p>Autopublish if fully SFW (green).</p>
<p>Borderline → autoblur/autocrop; publish with “sensitive” overlay;
enqueue human review SLA ≤ 24h.</p>
<p>Block &amp; queue if explicit/illegal or disallowed text (red).</p>
<p>Human review (moderation queue) → Approve / BlurandPublish / Remove
with reason / Escalate to T&amp;S (§4.14.3).</p>
<p>Publish → search cards always use SFW thumbnails; portfolio detail
uses SFW or blur taptoreveal (if marked sensitive but allowed).</p>
<p>Firsttime uploader policy: premoderate first N=10 portfolio items
(editable via §4.14.2) to set quality baseline.</p>
<p>C) Queues &amp; SLAs</p>
<p>Priority A (P0/P1 handoff from T&amp;S): explicit sexual/child
safety/violent threats → immediate takedown, SLA 15–30 min.</p>
<p>Priority B (policy/borderline): nudity boundaries, hate symbols,
offplatform payment steering → SLA 24 h.</p>
<p>Priority C (quality/metadata): miscategorization, spam,
duplicate/loweffort → SLA 72 h.</p>
<p>Queue cards show: surface (profile/portfolio/feed), uploader role,
city, verification badges, classifier confidence, prior violations, and
report count.</p>
<p>D) Rules by Surface</p>
<p>Profiles &amp; Service Profiles</p>
<p>Avatar/cover must be SFW; bios may not include contact handles or
payment details; location granular to city (no home address).</p>
<p>Role tags and NSFW switches are not usercontrolled; they derive from
content classification and policy.</p>
<p>Portfolio</p>
<p>Must remain SFW in preview. If artistic nudity is present, the system
enforces autocrop/blur for thumbnails and grid previews.</p>
<p>No exposed genitals; female nipples not visible in previews; implied
nudity ok with strategic coverage.</p>
<p>Feed posts</p>
<p>Same preview constraints as portfolio; no explicit calltooffplatform
payments; collaboration tags require consent (accept/deny).</p>
<p>Reviews</p>
<p>Disallow slurs, harassment, doxxing, explicit language; allow
experiencebased criticism.</p>
<p>Only verified booking participants can post (per §1.4).</p>
<p>Studios</p>
<p>Images show space/amenities only; no explicit sets; safety
disclosures required for hazardous features.</p>
<p>RFP briefs</p>
<p>Disallow sexualized gig requests; disallow offplatform payment
instructions; require budget ranges.</p>
<p>E) Automated Signals &amp; Thresholds (configurable via §4.14.2)</p>
<p>NSFW classifier with three bands: allow, sensitiveallow (blur),
block.</p>
<p>OCR PII detection: email/phone/payment handles → autoredact in public
captions; warn uploader.</p>
<p>Keyword denylist (nsfw.keyword_denylist): sexual solicitation, hate
slurs, offplatform payment verbs/handles.</p>
<p>Hash banlist: known abusive images (internal + partner lists).</p>
<p>Spam heuristics: rapid identical posts, URL stuffing, engagement bait
→ throttle.</p>
<p>F) UserFacing UX</p>
<p>During upload: live preview shows autocrop/blur; user can adjust crop
within SFW bounds (hard stops).</p>
<p>After decision:</p>
<p>Approved: normal publish.</p>
<p>Sensitiveallow: blur overlay with “Tap to view” + policy tooltip.</p>
<p>Removed: user receives reason code, policy excerpt, and appeal
link.</p>
<p>Tagging: tagged collaborators must accept before content shows on
their profile/feed.</p>
<p>Education nudges: “Previews must be SFW—here’s how to
crop/cover.”</p>
<p>G) Enforcement &amp; Escalation</p>
<p>Autoactions on violation counts (rolling 30 days):</p>
<p>2 content removals → Content warning + education card.</p>
<p>3 removals → DM throttle + search demotion.</p>
<p>4 removals → IB off and Boost suppression; queue to T&amp;S.</p>
<p>Hard violations (explicit sexual content, child/younglooking
sexualized, hate symbols) → immediate takedown + Strike2/3 (T&amp;S
ladder) and potential suspension.</p>
<p>Appeals: within 14 days; reviewed by a separate moderator or Neutral
Review if highimpact.</p>
<p>H) Tools for Moderators</p>
<p>Sidebyside original vs preview thumbnail; crop grid overlay;
sensitive area heatmap.</p>
<p>Redact inline (captions/hashtags); system stores hash of
original.</p>
<p>Batch actions for spam waves; bulk restore/remove with single
reason.</p>
<p>Simulateas card: preview how a search card will render
postdecision.</p>
<p>Policy helper: quick links to current §1.5 rules and cityspecific
appendums.</p>
<p>I) Integrations &amp; Handoffs</p>
<p>Trust &amp; Safety (§4.14.3): escalations (P0/P1), sanctions ladder
updates, strike sync.</p>
<p>Search (§4.14.2): demotion flags, sensitiveallow affects ranking
weights (minor).</p>
<p>Support (§4.14.5): user communications, appeal tickets, macros.</p>
<p>Promotions (§3.3): promoted inventory excludes “sensitiveallow”
unless explicitly allowed by config.</p>
<p>Verification (§4.13): repeated misrepresentation → require
reverify.</p>
<p>J) Metrics &amp; Quality</p>
<p>Operational KPIs</p>
<p>Autoapprove ratio (target ≥ 85% after first10 gating phase)</p>
<p>Timetodecision median (Priority B ≤ 8h)</p>
<p>Appeal rate &amp; overturn rate (goal &lt; 10% overturn)</p>
<p>Repeat violation rate (per 30/90 days)</p>
<p>Sensitiveallow share and CTR impact (ensure buyer trust)</p>
<p>Offplatform payment phrase incidence (monthovermonth ↓)</p>
<p>Quality</p>
<p>Weekly calibration sessions; golden set refresh; reviewer agreement
rate.</p>
<p>Classifier drift monitor (precision/recall on labeled sample).</p>
<p>K) Telemetry (Moderation)</p>
<p>mod.upload.scan.start/result (nsfw_band, ocr_hits)</p>
<p>mod.auto.crop/applied • mod.auto.blur/applied</p>
<p>mod.queue.enqueue/dequeue (priority) • mod.decision

<p>mod.violation.count.update • mod.auto.sanction.trigger</p>
<p>mod.hash.ban.hit • mod.keyword.hit • mod.redact.caption</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.4 FINAL)</p>
<p>Endtoend upload→screen→publish pipeline with placeholders and
subsecond automated screening.</p>
<p>NSFW classifier, OCR PII, keyword denylist, hash banlist, and virus
scan wired; thresholds configurable via §4.14.2.</p>
<p>Autocrop/blur for previews; hard stops to keep thumbnails SFW; user
crop UI present.</p>
<p>Moderation queues with Priority A/B/C SLAs; decision actions
(approve/blur/remove/escalate).</p>
<p>User notifications with reason codes and appeal flow; taggedcontent
acceptance.</p>
<p>Autosanctions for repeated violations; hard violations escalate to
T&amp;S.</p>
<p>Integrations with Search, T&amp;S, Support, Promotions,
Verification.</p>
<p>Metrics dashboards and calibration workflow; Telemetry events
emitted.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>SFW by design keeps payment partners comfortable and buyers
confident, while still enabling artistic expression.</p>
<p>Fast automation + human judgment gives scale without losing
nuance.</p>
<p>Clear user tools (crop/blur, appeals) reduce friction and educate
creators.</p>
<p>Tunable policies via §4.14.2 let Ops adjust thresholds citybycity
without code</p>
<p>§4.14.5 — Support &amp; Disputes</p>
<p>Goal: Resolve issues fast, fair, and policyaccurately—with minimal
engineering. Give agents nocode tools to calculate outcomes, capture
evidence, coordinate with Trust/Safety and Finance, and issue amended
receipts/credits with a clear audit trail.</p>
<p>A) Channels &amp; Intake</p>
<p>Inapp Help → “Report/Resolve a Problem” from: Booking, Chat thread,
Delivery screen, Studio page.</p>
<p>Email &amp; Web form (for loggedout users on brand accounts).</p>
<p>Autocases from signals: missed checkin/out, late/no delivery,
accessfailure events, chargeback opened, payment duplicate, travelfee
dispute, offplatformpayment attempt (flagged).</p>
<p>Intake schema (prefilled from context): booking IDs (LBGaware),
role(s), city, timestamps, house rules/SOW version, deliverables
manifest, chat transcript link, deposit status, verification badges,
prior strike history.</p>
<p>B) Case Types &amp; Routing</p>
<p>Operational: reschedule, change order, pricing correction, travel fee
dispute.</p>
<p>Nondelivery/Quality: late/no delivery, partial delivery, unusable
media.</p>
<p>Attendance: buyer/provider noshow, late arrival (both sides).</p>
<p>Access (Studios): code/lock failure, unsafe conditions,
damages/deposit claims.</p>
<p>Money: duplicate charge, overcharge, refund request, invoice edits,
ACH retry.</p>
<p>Safetycolored: harassment, boundary violations, escorting
solicitation (autolink to §4.14.3).</p>
<p>Payments network: chargeback (card issuer) → evidence pack &amp;
representment.</p>
<p>Routing rules</p>
<p>Safetycolored → T&amp;S queue with Support shadow.</p>
<p>Deposit claims → Support + Finance bin.</p>
<p>LBG cases → “Group” handler with perleg subtabs.</p>
<p>C) SLAs &amp; Priorities</p>
<p>Priority 0 (Safety): first response ≤ 15–30 min (T&amp;S lead,
Support copilot).</p>
<p>Priority 1 (Access/Noshow/Active booking): first response ≤ 1 h;
resolution target ≤ 24 h.</p>
<p>Priority 2 (Money/Delivery/Quality): first response ≤ 8 h; resolution
≤ 72 h.</p>
<p>Priority 3 (General): response ≤ 24 h; resolution ≤ 5 d.</p>
<p>Timers display in case header; breaches flagged and escalated.</p>
<p>D) Agent Workspace (Case View)</p>
<p>Header: severity, SLA timer, booking chip(s), role(s), city, deposit
state, payouts frozen?, promotions eligibility, strikes.</p>
<p>Timeline: booking events, chat excerpts (expand), delivery manifest
(hashes, sizes), acceptance/rejection log, studio rules snapshot,
location (fuzzed).</p>
<p>Evidence panel: upload files, link docs, annotate; chainofcustody
hash.</p>
<p>Policy helper: pulls effective config from §4.14.2 (refund bands,
acceptance window, travel fee bands, deposit defaults).</p>
<p>Calculators drawer (see next).</p>
<p>Actions: refund/partial, credit, deposit capture/void, change order,
reschedule, amended receipt, sanction shortcuts (IB off/DM
throttle).</p>
<p>E) Calculators (nocode, policyaccurate)</p>
<p>Refund Calculator<br />
Inputs: role, cancel timing or lateness, price lines
(packages/addons/license/travel), policy bands.<br />
Output: buyer refund $; provider clawback $; platform fee adjustments;
who pays processor fees per policy.<br />
Oneclick Apply → posts ledger events + issues amended receipt
(§4.12).</p>
<p>Delivery/Acceptance Calculator<br />
Inputs: due date, posted date, items delivered vs promised, acceptance
window, revision rounds left.<br />
Output: “Eligible for partial refund X%” or “Request revision” path;
sets autoreminder in the thread.</p>
<p>Travel Fee Calculator<br />
Inputs: geo distance (map link), city override bands from §4.14.2.<br />
Output: allowable travel fee or adjustment recommendation.</p>
<p>Deposit Claim Calculator (Studios)<br />
Inputs: evidence, claimed damages types, cap %, expiry.<br />
Output: capture up to $Y; requires twoperson approval when &gt;
threshold.</p>
<p>F) Standard Workflows (Playbooks)</p>
<p>1) Reschedule / Change Order</p>
<p>Propose new time; pricing delta autocomputed; both parties accept →
SOW updates → amended receipt.</p>
<p>2) Buyer Noshow</p>
<p>Confirm arrival logs; provider/studio present?</p>
<p>Policy outcome: buyer forfeits %; provider paid per bands; strike
optional if abuse.</p>
<p>3) Provider Noshow / Late</p>
<p>Confirm location logs; attempt contact in thread.</p>
<p>Outcome: refund buyer; provider forfeits; strike (T&amp;S); remove
Boost eligibility window.</p>
<p>4) Late / Partial Delivery</p>
<p>Run Delivery calculator; offer revision first if within rounds;
otherwise partial refund per matrix.</p>
<p>5) Quality Dispute</p>
<p>Require 3 examples &amp; rationale; compare to SOW.</p>
<p>If subjective with adequate delivery, educate + deny; if objective
miss, partial refund.</p>
<p>6) Studio Access Failure</p>
<p>Validate instructions sent and code logs; if host fault →
full/partial refund; deposit void.</p>
<p>Offer Relocation (city curated list) + goodwill credit (config
caps).</p>
<p>7) Deposit Claims (Studio)</p>
<p>Require timestamped photos, house rules match; capture up to cap;
disputed? move to Neutral Review.</p>
<p>8) Duplicate/Overcharge</p>
<p>Verify processor logs; refund excess; issue amended receipt.</p>
<p>9) Chargebacks</p>
<p>Freeze related payouts; assemble evidence pack (receipts, chat,
acceptance logs, deliverables hashes, location fuzz logs); submit; track
outcome; if lost, apply platform loss policy.</p>
<p>10) LBG: Talent ok / Studio failed (or vice versa)</p>
<p>Prorate group: refund failed leg; preserve valid leg; issue Group
amended receipt.</p>
<p>G) Neutral Review Panel (Ambiguous / Highimpact)</p>
<p>Composition: 2 Support seniors + 1 crossfunction (T&amp;S/Finance) →
majority decision.</p>
<p>Inputs: timeline, evidence, calculators’ outputs, policy excerpt,
customer narratives.</p>
<p>Outcomes: uphold/modify/overturn; optional goodwill credit; document
rationale; update Reputation and strikes if applicable.</p>
<p>H) Credits &amp; Goodwill (Guardrails)</p>
<p>Goodwill credits are marketingfunded, scoped to city/role, with
percase and peragent monthly caps (from §4.14.2).</p>
<p>Autoexclusion: users with active strikes or abuse patterns.</p>
<p>On apply: credit line appears in receipt; expiry date; cannot be
withdrawn as cash.</p>
<p>I) Automation &amp; Triggers</p>
<p>Autoopen case: missed checkin/out, no delivery by T+X hours,
accessfailure signal, duplicate charge, chargeback.</p>
<p>Autosuggest macros: populate opening message using case type &amp;
policy; agent reviews/edits.</p>
<p>Autoreminders: revision requested → followup in 48h; acceptance
window about to expire.</p>
<p>J) Comms &amp; Templates</p>
<p>Template packs (editable in §4.14.10): safetyneutral, plainEnglish,
localized.</p>
<p>Macros per case type with dynamic fields (names, amounts, dates,
policy links).</p>
<p>Tone checks: disallow blamey or legalese phrases; suggest neutral
alternatives.</p>
<p>K) Integrations &amp; Handoffs</p>
<p>Finance (§4.14.6): refunds/credits/deposit captures post to ledger;
payout holds released on resolve.</p>
<p>T&amp;S (§4.14.3): safetycolored cases mirror to T&amp;S; sanctions
reflected back.</p>
<p>Content (§4.14.4): if dispute reveals policybreaking content →
removal &amp; strike handoff.</p>
<p>Tax (§4.12): amended receipts reflect tax deltas; yearend summaries
updated.</p>
<p>Analytics (Section 5): case and resolution data to warehouse.</p>
<p>L) Metrics &amp; QA</p>
<p>Ops KPIs</p>
<p>First response &amp; timetoresolution by queue.</p>

<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Fast, fair, consistent outcomes without engineering.</p>
<p>One case, full picture: booking, chat, deliverables, rules—reduces
backandforth.</p>
<p>Policyaccurate math via calculators prevents costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Auditable: amended receipts, evidence hashes, and documented
rationales.</p>
<p>§4.14.6 — Finance &amp; Payouts Ops</p>
<p>Goal: Run money ops safely and fast—payouts, reserves,
refunds/credits, deposits, chargebacks, promos—without code changes.
Keep books clean (escrow/recognition), minimize leakage and loss, and
provide auditable, reversible actions with dualapproval where
needed.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Roles</p>
<p>Who uses this: Finance, Support (limited), Ops/Marketing (promos),
Readonly Auditors.<br />
What it controls: payout batches &amp; reserves, Early Payouts,
refunds/credits, studio deposits, chargebacks/representment,
coupons/promos, daily reconciliation, revenue recognition exports.</p>
<p>Guardrails: Moneycritical actions require twoperson approval per
§4.14.1 (manual payout, fee override, deposit capture &gt; $1k, tax
category overrides).</p>

<p>At refund: reverse appropriate portions; taxes per jurisdiction
rules</p>
<p>At payout: Dr Payable / Cr Cash; reserves retained as liability</p>
<p>Deposits: not GMV; separate liability “Deposits held”; capture/void
moves between liabilities and cash.</p>
<p>All journaling exported; detail remains in data warehouse (Section
5).</p>

travel)</p>
<p>ACH/card: refund path chosen based on original method; if method
expired, create credit memo</p>

<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.6 FINAL)</p>
<p>Payout batches with retry/changebank and reserve visibility; Early
Payout peruse with fee math.</p>
<p>Reserves (newprovider &amp; rolling) configurable via §4.14.2;
applied &amp; released with schedules.</p>
<p>Refunds/Adjustments recompute fees/taxes and issue amended receipts
automatically.</p>
<p>Studio deposits: holds visible; capture/void/release with evidence
and dualapproval &gt; threshold; separate receipt.</p>
<p>Chargebacks: webhook ingestion, evidence pack builder, representment
submission, payout freezes.</p>
<p>Coupons/Promos: create/manage; burn tracking; wallet line items
posted.</p>
<p>Reconciliation &amp; RevRec exports: daily variances, monthend packs,
escrow/tax/deposit liabilities tieouts.</p>
<p>Runbooks &amp; Alerts documented and wired; telemetry events emitted;
dashboards live.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Ops speed without risk: common money flows are oneclick with
calculators and dual approvals.</p>
<p>Clean books by default: escrow vs revenue vs liabilities handled
consistently; audits are painless.</p>
<p>Loss containment: reserves, evidence packs, and alerts reduce
chargeback and refund leakage.</p>
<p>Citybycity control: economics tuned in §4.14.2; Finance executes
without code.</p>
<p>§4.14.7 — Tax &amp; Compliance Ops</p>
<p>Goal: Operate U.S. taxes and compliance without code changes: collect
W9s, resolve TIN mismatches, run and deliver 1099s, manage marketplace
salestax (destinationbased) with a tax engine, file remittances on time,
and keep a defensible audit trail—with dual approvals on sensitive
moves.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Roles</p>
<p>Who uses this: Finance (lead), Tax &amp; Compliance, Readonly
Auditor; limited Support (view-only for ticket replies).<br />
What it covers: W9 onboarding &amp; edelivery consent, TIN matching,
1099 generation/efile/delivery/corrections, marketplace salestax nexus
tracking, tax category mapping, calculation monitoring, return filing
calendar, audit pack exports.</p>
<p>Guardrails: Changes that affect tax exposure (nexus list, category
map, backdated overrides, rate overrides) require twoperson approval per
§4.14.1.</p>
<p>B) Dashboards &amp; Queues</p>
<p>Tax Overview (/admin/tax)</p>
<p>Tiles: W9 coverage %, TIN mismatch open, 1099 run status, states with
nexus, calc error rate, next filings due.</p>
<p>Trendlines: taxable vs nontaxable share by role; effective tax
collected by state/city.</p>
<p>Queues</p>
<p>W9 Missing/Invalid (payoutblocking on): missing, expired name/TIN,
signature not captured.</p>
<p>TIN Mismatch: new mismatches, under review, resolved.</p>
<p>1099 Exceptions: address issues, duplicate TINs, threshold edge
cases, bounced emails, paper mail required.</p>
<p>Calc Exceptions: timeouts, “no code found,” zero tax where expected,
jurisdiction mismatch.</p>
<p>C) W9 / TIN / EDelivery Management</p>
<p>W9 Control Panel</p>
<p>Status filters: Not started • In progress • Submitted • Valid • Needs
correction.</p>
<p>Actions: Request W9 (nudge), Resend link, Block payouts toggle
(automated default ON when missing), Mark corrected after user
resubmits.</p>
<p>Evidence: signed PDF, submission timestamp, IP/device, consent
texts.</p>
<p>TIN Match (soft)</p>
<p>Batch and ondemand checks; results classified: Match • Mismatch •
Indeterminate.</p>
<p>Workflow: On mismatch → Notify user (selfserve fix) → if unresolved
in 7 days, escalate to Support for assisted correction → remain
payoutblocked.</p>
<p>Audit: history of match attempts, result codes; no raw SSN ever shown
(PII scope gates per §4.14.1).</p>
<p>EDelivery Consent</p>
<p>Global percentage, by cohort.</p>
<p>Actions: Request consent template, Revoke on user request.</p>
<p>If no consent or unopened by deadline, queue paper mail fulfillment
with address verification.</p>
<p>D) 1099 Runs &amp; Corrections</p>
<p>Config (no code)</p>
<p>Thresholds: dynamic edition (managed by Finance) with notes; never
hardcoded into receipts.</p>
<p>Form type: platformissued 1099NEC vs processorissued (if using PSE
route) — select per tax season.</p>
<p>Run windows: preclose (draft), final generate, efile, deliver (by Jan
31 target).</p>
<p>Run Workflow</p>
<p>Preflight: snapshot gross payouts, exclude refunds/chargebacks as
policy dictates; show exceptions (missing W9, TIN mismatch, missing
address).</p>
<p>Preview: perpayee summary with deltas vs prior drafts; download
sample PDFs; dual approval to proceed.</p>
<p>Efile: submit batch to filing provider (IRS + Combined Federal/State
where applicable); capture submission IDs.</p>
<p>Deliver: email with secure link to PDF for consented users; queue
mail for the rest; track opens and bounces.</p>
<p>Corrections: create CCORR entries with reason (address fix, amount
update, TIN correction); refile and redeliver; maintain version
chain.</p>
<p>Status &amp; Controls</p>
<p>States: Draft • Pending approval • Filed • Delivered • Correction
pending.</p>
<p>Bounced/undeliverable queue with address change flow (Support can
help).</p>
<p>Export 1099 Ledger CSV: payee, TIN masked, gross, box amounts, file
IDs.</p>
<p>E) SalesTax Nexus &amp; Category Mapping (Marketplace
Facilitator)</p>
<p>Nexus Map</p>
<p>States list with toggles: Collect &amp; remit ON/OFF, basis
(economic/physical), notes.</p>
<p>Economic triggers monitor: GMV and transaction count by state vs
configurable thresholds; alert if approaching.</p>
<p>Twoperson approval to mark a state ON/OFF; prompt to schedule
effective date/time.</p>
<p>Category Mapping (what is being taxed)</p>
<p>Role/service to tax code mapping (e.g., Talent service,
Photography/Videography service, Studio shortterm rental, Cleaning fee,
Digital license).</p>
<p>Editor: pick codes from tax engine catalog; perstate overrides where
needed; reason required; dual approval for overrides.</p>
<p>Simulation: price example shows expected tax in a target city/county;
compares before/after.</p>
<p>Exemptions (Phase 2)</p>
<p>Buyer tax exemption certificates: upload, verify, expire;
statespecific validation; apply per booking only if valid and
applicable; audit record kept.</p>
<p>F) Calculation Monitoring &amp; Exceptions</p>
<p>Live Monitor</p>
<p>Success %, latency p95/p99; top states/cities by volume.</p>
<p>“Zero where expected” detector: service/location combos historically
taxable now returning 0.</p>
<p>Timeouts: fallback policy (failclosed for money safety) blocks
checkout or shows “Tax unavailable—please retry”; agent override path
(rare) requires dual approval and postfix reconciliation.</p>
<p>Exception Resolution</p>
<p>No code found: add/adjust category mapping; rerun calc; annotate
case.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction mismatch: verify location; correct geocode; recalc.</p>
<p>Engine outage: enable grace mode flag (killswitch in §4.14.2) →
temporarily suspend new checkouts or switch to backup strategy;
autonotify Eng/Ops.</p>
<p>G) Filing Calendar &amp; Remittance</p>
<p>Calendar</p>
<p>State filing frequencies (monthly/quarterly/annual) with due dates;
owner assigned; reminders at T14/T7/T2 days.</p>
<p>Each filing stores: period, gross taxable, tax collected, returns
submitted, confirmation numbers, PDFs.</p>
<p>Rollups: city/county breakdowns; shortpaid/overpaid trackers.</p>
<p>Payments</p>
<p>Record ACH/epay confirmations; reconcile remitted vs collected;
variance report.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Jurisdiction CSV for the period (state/county/city), taxable base,
tax, count, exempt amount; importready for filing portals or CPA.</p>
<p>H) Knowledge Base &amp; Policy Text (External)</p>
<p>KB articles linked from receipts/Tax Center: “Where we collect tax”,
“Why was tax charged?”, “How 1099 works”, “How to fix a W9
mismatch”.</p>
<p>Templates maintained via §4.14.10 Smart Docs CMS; localized; review
by Tax.</p>
<p>I) Metrics &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>KPIs</p>
<p>W9 coverage ≥ target (e.g., 98% of active payees).</p>
<p>TIN mismatch resolution median (≤ 7 days).</p>
<p>1099 ontime issuance rate (target 100%).</p>
<p>Calc error rate &lt; 0.5%; average calc latency &lt; 1.5s.</p>

<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.7 FINAL)</p>
<p>W9/TIN module with payoutblock, consent capture, mismatch workflow,
and signed PDFs stored with audit.</p>
<p>1099 run system: preflight, preview, dualapproval, efile,
edelivery/paper fallback, corrections flow with version chain.</p>
<p>Nexus map and economic triggers; twoperson approval to toggle;
scheduled effective dates.</p>
<p>Category mapping editor with simulation; perstate overrides;
approvals &amp; audit.</p>
<p>Calc monitor with latency, errorrate, and “zero where expected”
detectors; outage grace mode.</p>
<p>Filing calendar with reminders, submission records, confirmations,
and jurisdiction exports.</p>
<p>KB links &amp; templates maintained via §4.14.10; Support sees
statuses for ticket replies.</p>
<p>Metrics &amp; alerts dashboards; Telemetry events for all listed
actions.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Automates the heavy lifting (forms, calcs, filings) while keeping
humans in the loop where judgment matters.</p>
<p>Prevents surprises with nexus monitoring, exception queues, and dual
approvals on exposurechanging edits.</p>
<p>Auditable &amp; defensible: signed forms, efile IDs, mapping changes,
and filing confirmations are all in one place.</p>
<p>§4.14.8 — Promotions &amp; Marketplace Economics</p>
<p>Goal: Give Ops/Marketing a nocode control tower for paid visibility
that drives incremental bookings without corrupting relevance: configure
CPC floors and Featured pricing citybycity, tune Quality Score (QS)
weights, enforce density/frequency caps, manage eligibility/safety, run
experiments, and measure true incrementality (ROAS)—all with guardrails,
audits, and rollbacks.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Ops (city/market), Marketing, Finance
(billing/credits), Trust &amp; Safety (eligibility), Readonly
Auditor.<br />
What it controls: Search Boost (CPC), Featured Carousels (weekly flat),
eligibility gates, QS weighting, density/frequency caps, citytier CPC
floors, delivery guarantees &amp; makegoods, experiments, fraud
controls, wallet credits.<br />
Guardrails: “Never paytowin”—paid units must match query/filters; caps
enforced (≤2/20; ≤1 above fold); Promoted label shown; safety
eligibility in effect (ID Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no recent strikes).</p>
<p>B) Inventory Model (what can be sold)</p>
<p>Search Results Boost (CPC)</p>
<p>Placement: inline search cards; ribbons autogenerated (“Instant
Book”, “Trusted Pro”, “Available this week”).</p>
<p>Capacity controls: density cap per page and frequency caps per buyer
(config in §4.14.2).</p>
<p>Charging: per valid click (invalid click credits autoapply to
wallet).</p>
<p>Featured Carousels (Weekly Flat)</p>
<p>Placement: Home + category landing (“Featured in Houston”; “Featured
Photographers”).</p>
<p>Slots: 10–16 per carousel; rotational pacing with impression
guarantees &amp; makegood logic.</p>
<p>Creative rules: No custom creatives. We render the standard profile
card + approved ribbon variants only (prevents deception and review
load).</p>
<p>C) City Tiers &amp; Pricing Governance</p>
<p>City tiers: A (e.g., HOU/DAL/LA/NYC/ATL), B (growth metros), C
(smaller).</p>
<p>CPC floors per city×role (e.g., HOU:model = $0.90) and weekly
Featured prices per city×role (e.g., $69/wk).</p>
<p>Scheduling: price changes can be scheduled (start/end) with local
timezone; staged rollouts.</p>
<p>Review cadence: monthly CPC floor review (±$0.10–0.20) based on fill
rate, CPB, ROAS; quarterly Featured pricing review (impression delivery
&amp; bookings/slot).</p>
<p>Dual approval: any CPC floor increase ≥ $0.20 in 24h, or Featured
price change ≥ 20% requires twoperson approval (per §4.14.1).</p>
<p>Keys live in §4.14.2: promos.boosts.cpc_floor.city_role,
promos.featured.weekly_price.city_role.</p>
<p>D) Eligibility, Targeting &amp; Safety</p>
<p>Eligibility rule (configurable DSL): default id_verified &amp;&amp;
rep&gt;=70 &amp;&amp; !recent_strike.</p>
<p>NSFW/Safe Mode: paid units respect city NSFW visibility and Safe Mode
thresholds (from §4.14.2).</p>
<p>Targeting knobs: city, radius, role; negative keywords (provider can
exclude).</p>
<p>Autosuppression: any active Safety investigation or miscategorized
profile → campaign paused until cleared.</p>
<p>E) Ranking Inside Paid Caps (fair ordering)</p>
<p>Within paid slots only:</p>
<p>Quality Score (0–1) components (weights tunable in §4.14.2):</p>
<p>Exact filter match fit (role/location/price/availability)</p>
<p>Responsiveness (firstresponse time &amp; rate)</p>
<p>Rep Score</p>
<p>Instant Book enabled</p>
<p>Price fit to query median</p>
<p>Historical CTR (timedecayed)</p>
<p>Paid Order Score: score = log(bid) * α + QS * (1−α) (default α=0.5;
guardrails 0.3–0.7).</p>
<p>Tiebreak: lower effective CPC (bid ÷ QS) wins to reward
relevance.</p>
<p>Keys: promos.boosts.qs_weight_bid,
promos.boosts.qs_weight_quality.</p>
<p>F) Fraud, Quality &amp; Budget Protection</p>
<p>Invalid click detection: rapid repeats, zerodwell bounces, selfclick
signatures, coordinated patterns; invalidated charges autocredit within
24h to wallet.</p>
<p>Frequency caps (buyerside): 2 impressions/session, 5/day/provider, 4h
cooldown.</p>
<p>Budget safety: daily overspend guard (≤5%); autopause if anomaly;
alert Ops.</p>
<p>Abuse flags: misleading pricing or availability → autopause all
promos; route to T&amp;S.</p>
<p>G) Admin UI — Controls &amp; Flows</p>
<p>1) Floors &amp; Pricing Editor</p>
<p>Table per city×role: CPC floor $, avg QS, fill %, median CPC, CPB,
ROAS; edit floors inline; schedule changes; staged rollout slider.</p>
<p>Featured grid: weekly price ladder; slots booked vs inventory;
impression guarantees; set makegood rules (auto credit or
extension).</p>
<p>2) Eligibility &amp; Caps</p>
<p>Toggle eligibility DSL (with validator), set density/frequency caps;
set ribbon allowlist.</p>
<p>3) QS Weights &amp; Preview</p>
<p>Adjust α and QS subweights (guardrails); simulate ordering on last N
queries; diff view vs current.</p>
<p>4) Experiments</p>
<p>Create A/B cells: density caps A(2/20) vs B(1/20); QS α 0.5 vs 0.3;
ribbon text variants.</p>
<p>Set success metrics (ROAS lift, CPB↓, buyer CTR↑); autostop on trust
KPI breach (e.g., “Hide promoted” &gt; 3%).</p>
<p>5) Credits &amp; MakeGoods</p>
<p>Issue wallet credits (invalid clicks, makegood for underdelivered
Featured); caps and reasons required; ledger posted to Finance.</p>
<p>6) Reporting</p>
<p>Dashboards: adoption %, spend, CPC distribution, CPB, bookings
attributed, incremental GMV (holdout), ROAS percentiles, invalid click
rate, buyer “Hide” rate, revenue contribution.</p>
<p>H) Measurement &amp; Incrementality</p>
<p>Attribution: click → inquiry → booking → GMV; 7day postclick window;
firsttouch within paid.</p>
<p>Holdout design: rolling 10% eligible supply suppressed from paid to
estimate incremental bookings/GMV; configurable (5–10%).</p>
<p>Core KPIs: median ROAS ≥ 2.5×, CPB targets by role, invalid click
rate &lt; 7%, buyer “Hide promoted” ≤ 3%, paid revenue mix 10–15% by
month 6.</p>
<p>Cohort views: new vs returning providers; city cohorts; role
cohorts.</p>
<p>I) Finance &amp; Billing Integration</p>
<p>Wallet ledger: CPC charges (valid clicks), Featured weekly charges,
invalid click credits, makegoods.</p>
<p>Prepaid vs payasyougo: support both; card on file; lowbalance
alerts.</p>
<p>Refund policy: only invalid clicks autocredit; Featured makegoods
issued on short delivery (impressions) or outages.</p>
<p>J) Alerts &amp; Safeguards</p>
<p>Spend spike &gt; X% houroverhour in a city/role.</p>
<p>Invalid clicks &gt; 10% for any provider in 24h.</p>
<p>Buyer “Hide promoted” rate &gt; 3% dayoverday.</p>
<p>ROAS median &lt; 2.0× for 7 days in a city → suggest floor drop or QS
tuning.</p>
<p>Inventory saturation: density cap hits 90% for 3 days → consider
raising floor or adding slots cautiously (with A/B).</p>
<p>K) Telemetry (Promotions)</p>
<p>promo.boost.floor.update • promo.featured.price.update •
promo.eligibility.update</p>
<p>promo.qs.tune (alpha, weights) • promo.simulation.run</p>

<p>promo.charge.click.valid/invalid • promo.credit.makegood</p>
<p>promo.metrics.roas.update • promo.alert.trigger (type)</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.8 FINAL)</p>
<p>CPC floors and Featured weekly pricing editable per city×role;
scheduled; dualapproval for large changes.</p>
<p>Eligibility rule editor with validator; safety gating enforced (ID
Verified + Rep ≥ 70 + no strikes).</p>
<p>Density &amp; frequency caps configurable; respected at runtime;
Promoted labeling present.</p>
<p>QS weights tunable with simulation; ordering formula log(bid)*α +
QS*(1−α) enforced within paid slots only.</p>
<p>Fraud controls: invalid click detection with autocredits; overspend
guard; abuse autopause.</p>
<p>Experiments on caps, QS α, ribbons; autostop on trust KPI breach.</p>
<p>Reporting: spend, CPC, CPB, attributed bookings/GMV, incremental ROAS
via holdout, invalid click &amp; hide rates, revenue contribution.</p>
<p>Wallet &amp; Finance linkage for charges, credits, makegoods; audit
trail intact.</p>
<p>Alerts on spikes, quality thresholds, low ROAS, inventory saturation;
Telemetry events firing.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Citybycity control without code lets you stabilize early markets and
price inventory rationally.</p>
<p>Fairness preserved: relevance first, paid only in marked slots,
strict caps—so buyers trust results.</p>
<p>Provable value keeps spend durable (holdoutmeasured ROAS).</p>
<p>Operationally safe: fraud shielding, autocredits, experiments with
guardrails, and quick rollbacks.</p>
<p>§4.14.9 — City Ops &amp; Supply Seeding</p>
<p>Goal: Give Ops a nocode cockpit to launch and grow each city: set
supply targets by role, seed highquality providers and studios, run
foundingcity perks, balance demand vs. supply, and keep
rotations/spotlights fair—without code changes.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: City/Market Ops (lead), Marketing (copilot), Trust
&amp; Safety (eligibility), Finance (budgets), Readonly Auditor.<br />
What it controls: city cohorts, supply targets, foundingcity perks,
verification subsidies, invite/referral programs, “Top in {City}”
rotations, studio seeding, demand seeding (brands/RFP), local events
(“Collab Day”), and city health dashboards.</p>
<p>Guardrails: All perks that change fees or issue credits draw from
approved budgets and obey eligibility (ID Verified, Rep ≥ 70, no
strikes). Fee/price changes use §4.14.2 approvals.</p>
<p>B) City Dashboard (at /admin/city/{city})</p>
<p>Health tiles (last 28 days, rolesplit: Models / Photographers /
Videographers / Creators)</p>
<p>Active supply (# with packages + availability) • Verified % • Instant
Book %</p>
<p>Buyer demand (searches, inquiries, bookings) • Fill rate (% inquiries
→ bookings)</p>
<p>Repeat bookings % • Median response time • Cancellation/noshow
rates</p>
<p>Pricing bands median vs target • Bookings heatmap by neighborhood •
Studio availability</p>
<p>Alerts</p>
<p>Supply/demand imbalance (e.g., photogs &lt; target ratio to
models)</p>
<p>Verified % below threshold • Response time drift • High cancel/noshow
pockets</p>
<p>Studio coverage below target • Budget burn approaching 80%</p>
<p>C) Targets &amp; Ratios (editable, guardrailed)</p>
<p>Supply targets by role (absolute # and % verified):</p>
<p>Example (Houston P0): Models 300 (≥60% ID Verified), Photographers
220 (≥55%), Videographers 120 (≥50%), Creators 200 (≥55%).</p>
<p>Balance ratios (min/max):</p>
<p>Model:Photographer target 1.2–1.8 • Model:Videographer 2.0–3.0 •
Creator:Photographer 0.7–1.3.</p>
<p>Studio coverage: ≥25 Verified Studios across ≥8 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Responsetime goal: median ≤ 2h; Instant Book share ≥ 35%.</p>
<p>(All thresholds live as keys in §4.14.2; dashboard shows current →
target with color coding.)</p>
<p>D) Cohort Builder &amp; Invites</p>
<p>Filters (role, distance radius, verification status, Rep, perplatform
social metrics, price band, availability, touring flag).<br />
Actions</p>
<p>Generate invite cohort: preview list, dedupe by email/social handle;
export or send.</p>
<p>Invite send: email/SMS templates (from §4.14.10), optional boost
coupon attachment.</p>
<p>Autoinvite rules: “When a provider in HOU links IG ≥ 25k &amp; ID
Verified → send ‘Founding Creator’ invite + $15 Boost.”</p>
<p>CSV import: offplatform prospect lists (studios, creators).
Merge/match to existing accounts; privacysafe.</p>
<p>Tracking</p>
<p>Conversion funnel: sent → opened → signup → verified → first package
→ first booking.</p>
<p>E) FoundingCity Perks &amp; Budgets</p>
<p>Perks (config via §4.14.2)</p>
<p>Buyer fee holiday (e.g., 0% buyer fee) — windowed</p>
<p>Provider fee nudge (e.g., −2% for 60 days) — capped by cohort</p>
<p>Verification subsidies: first N ID or Background passes funded</p>
<p>Boost starter credits: $15 on Trusted Pro pass (once)</p>
<p>Budgets</p>
<p>Tiles: allocated vs spent vs slated; alerts at 80/100%.</p>
<p>Makegood credits draw from promo budget; ledger posts to Finance
(§4.14.6).</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>Enforce: id_verified &amp;&amp; !recent_strike (and Trusted Pro where
applicable).</p>
<p>Cityscoped caps per user (e.g., max $30 in credits/30 days).</p>
<p>F) “Top in {City}” Rotations &amp; Merchandising</p>
<p>Carousels: “Top Models in Houston”, “…Photographers…”,
“…Videographers…”, “…Creators…”, “Verified Studios”.</p>
<p>Rotation logic: weighted roundrobin among eligible profiles (Rep ≥
threshold, IB on, recent positive reviews).</p>
<p>Fairness caps: max X impressions/week per profile; enforce diversity
(no duplicates in adjacent tiles).</p>
<p>Manual pin (rare): Ops can pin up to 2 slots for timeboxed campaigns
(record reason; autounpin).</p>
<p>A/B: carousel order and labels (e.g., “Available this week” vs
“Instant Book”).</p>
<p>G) Studio Seeding &amp; Coverage</p>
<p>Neighborhood heatmap with target coverage; shows Verified Studios and
peak booking windows.</p>
<p>Studio outreach cohort builder (amenities needed: cyclorama, natural

comms/templates in §4.14.10.)</p>
<p>K) Integrations</p>
<p>Promotions (§4.14.8): CPC floors per city×role, Featured price
ladders, eligibility.</p>
<p>Verification (§4.13): subsidy counts, Trusted Pro gating.</p>

<p>Metrics, alerts, telemetry implemented and visible; budgets
enforced.</p>
<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Citybycity control aligns product knobs with ground truth (coverage,
ratios, response time).</p>
<p>Seeding at scale: invites, perks, and events run from one place with
budgets and eligibility baked in.</p>
<p>Fair discovery: rotations with caps prevent “winnertakeall,”
improving breadth of bookings.</p>
<p>Tight integration with Promotions, Verification, Finance, and Support
ensures moves are both effective and auditable.</p>
<p>§4.14.10 — Smart Docs &amp; Templates CMS</p>
<p>Goal: Let Ops/Legal/Marketing manage contracts, releases, SOWs, House
Rules, and comms (email/SMS) without code—using a versioned clause
library, safe variables, approvals, localization, and oneclick
rollout/rollback. All documents and messages should be policyaccurate,
esignable, and auditable, and slot cleanly into booking, delivery,
disputes, and receipts.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this:</p>
<p>Legal (owner of legal templates) — clauses, SOW defaults, releases,
House Rules patterns.</p>
<p>Ops/Support — dispute macros, houserules packs, city addenda, safety
notices.</p>
<p>Marketing — email/SMS copy, onboarding &amp; lifecycle.</p>
<p>City Ops — localized notes, studio packs, event mailers.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>Twoperson approval required to publish legal docs or change variable
sets (Legal + Ops).</p>
<p>Live preview + “blastradius” diff for all publishes.</p>
<p>Version pinning per booking (the exact doc text is frozen on
create/accept).</p>
<p>B) Document Types &amp; Catalog</p>
<p>Legal/Operational docs (rendered as PDF &amp; HTML):</p>
<p>SOW (Statement of Work) — per role, roleaware fields
(talent/photog/videographer/creator) + LBG aware.</p>
<p>Model Release / Talent Release — 18+ only; IDverified signers; alias
display but legal name on signature page.</p>
<p>IP &amp; License Addenda — commercial/editorial usage, term,
geography, exclusivity, buyout options.</p>
<p>House Rules (Studio) — access, usage, equipment, noise, parking,
deposit grounds.</p>
<p>Safety Addenda — chaperone policy, emergency contact, areashare
consent, code of conduct.</p>
<p>Change Orders — schedule/price adjustments midthread.</p>
<p>Refund/Delivery Acknowledgements — standardized acceptance/refund
confirmations.</p>
<p>Tax Consent Texts — edelivery consent language (links with
§4.12/§4.14.7).</p>
<p>Messaging templates (transactional &amp; lifecycle):</p>
<p>Checkout/escrow, acceptance, reminders, reschedule, deliverables
due/accepted, revision prompts, dispute opened/closed, payout
queued/sent, 1099 available, verification nudges, city launch,
promotions.</p>
<p>C) Clause Library &amp; Safe Variables</p>
<p>Clause blocks:</p>
<p>Atomic, reusable paragraphs with conditions (role, city, studio, NSFW
state, presence of deposit, licensing tier).</p>
<p>Tags: #legal, #ops, #safety, #tax, #studio.</p>
<p>Deprecation with automigration suggestions (never changes older,
pinned documents).</p>
<p>Variable catalog (strongly typed &amp; validated):</p>
<p>Examples: {{booking.start_datetime_local}}, {{booking.city}},
{{party.buyer.display_name}}, {{party.seller.legal_name_masked}},
{{pricing.subtotal}}, {{license.scope}}, {{studio.deposit_cap}}.</p>
<p>Validators: required/optional, regex, min/max, enum; preview with
sample data before publish.</p>
<p>Forbidden variables in public surfaces (email/phone/payment handles)
are blocked.</p>
<p>D) Template Editor UI</p>
<p>Block editor (left: clause library, right: doc outline).</p>
<p>Conditions panel to include/exclude clauses by role/city/flags.</p>
<p>Variables inspector with type checks and autofill suggestions.</p>
<p>Diff viewer (before/after) + impact preview on 10 sample
bookings.</p>
<p>Version header: author, reason code, linked Jira/issue, publish
window (start/end), scopes (global/state/city/role).</p>
<p>Rollback button restores prior version in one click (future bookings
only).</p>
<p>E) Versioning, Approvals &amp; Publishing</p>
<p>States: Draft → Legal Review → Ops Review → Scheduled/Published →
Archived.</p>
<p>Approvals: Legal must approve legal doc changes; Marketing approves
comms; Ops approves city addenda.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; scheduling: publish per city/role/cohort with local
timezone; staged rollout (1%→10%→100%).</p>
<p>Pinning: each booking pins doc versions at create (SOW/House Rules)
and accept (releases/license).</p>
<p>Audit: immutable log with actor, reason, diffs, affected scopes, and
rollback link.</p>
<p>F) ESignatures &amp; Records (Docs)</p>
<p>Signature methods: typedname + checkbox + timestamp, or embedded
esign capture (hosted by provider).</p>
<p>Signer identity: ties to platform account; legal name private, shown
only on signature page and receipts.</p>
<p>Cosigners: both sides sign; LBG: talent/studio sign their respective
docs.</p>
<p>Records: render to PDF, hash &amp; store, link from booking and
receipts; download available to both parties.</p>
<p>18+ enforcement: release templates block minor language; ID Verified
required to sign talent releases.</p>
<p>G) SOW Generator (RoleAware)</p>
<p>Packages &amp; addons expanded with plainEnglish summaries; license
clause assembled (scope/term/geography/exclusivity).</p>
<p>Travel &amp; overtime clauses pulled from §4.14.2 policy
matrices.</p>
<p>Deliverables: count/type, format, due date/time; acceptance window;
revision rounds.</p>
<p>Cancellation bands summarized from policy; clear fee consequences by
timing.</p>
<p>LBG awareness: automatically emits Talent SOW and Studio House Rules;
ties to a Group Receipt (§4.12).</p>
<p>H) Studio Packs</p>
<p>House Rules templates with required fields: access, hazards,
occupancy, noise, equipment, cleaning, deposit basis.</p>
<p>Autoinsert deposit clause when deposit is enabled; photo evidence
checklist printed on receipt.</p>
<p>Neighborhood privacy: exact address withheld until confirmation; docs
display neighborhood + arrival instructions postaccept.</p>
<p>I) Dispute &amp; Support Macros</p>
<p>Reusable macro library for Support (approve/deny, partial refund,
revision required, deposit capture notice).</p>
<p>Variables: amounts, dates, links to receipts, policy excerpts; tone
guard flags accusatory/legalese; suggests neutral phrasing.</p>
<p>Appeal templates with timelines and escalation language aligned to
§4.14.5/§4.14.3.</p>
<p>J) Email/SMS Templates (Comms CMS)</p>
<p>Transactional: booking request, acceptance, reminders, deliverables
due/accepted, payout events, tax forms, verification status.</p>
<p>Lifecycle: onboarding nudge, verify your ID, Trusted Pro invite,
responsetime coaching, city event invites, ROAS tips for boosts.</p>
<p>Localization (Phase 2): perlanguage variants; righttoleft
support.</p>
<p>A/B variants for subject/preview lines; guardrails: transactional
emails cannot be suppressed below 100%; marketing adheres to unsubscribe
laws.</p>
<p>Ratelimit &amp; quiet hours (cityaware).</p>
<p>K) Localization &amp; City Addenda</p>
<p>City addenda blocks autoappend local rules (e.g., building access,
noise windows) selected by City Ops; translations linked.</p>
<p>U.S. only at launch; keep language keys prepared for expansion.</p>
<p>L) Integrations &amp; Embedding</p>
<p>Checkout (§4.7/§4.12): SOW and House Rules visible before pay;
acceptance checkboxes required.</p>
<p>Messaging (§1.4): change orders &amp; deliverables acceptance posted
into the thread with signed doc links.</p>
<p>Receipts (§4.12): link to the exact SOW, releases, House Rules on the
receipt and group receipt.</p>
<p>Disputes (§4.14.5): calculators reference the pinned policy text;
outcome templates autopopulate.</p>
<p>Promotions (§3.3): ribbon text snippets come from CMS allowlist (no
adhoc copy).</p>
<p>M) Governance &amp; Compliance</p>
<p>Legal owner for legal docs; Marketing owner for comms; Ops owner for
operational clauses.</p>
<p>Change windows for highrisk edits (e.g., not during peak booking days
unless emergency).</p>
<p>Readonly view for auditors; export of doc versions used per
booking.</p>
<p>PII minimization: public doc bodies never include emails/phones;
signature pages allowed but masked in previews.</p>
<p>N) Metrics &amp; Quality</p>
<p>Adoption: % bookings with SOW + release signed preshoot (target
100%).</p>
<p>Dispute defensibility: % disputes where pinned docs directly support
outcome; chargeback win uplift postCMS update.</p>
<p>Comms performance: open/click for transactional (informational),
lifecycle conversion to verification/IB.</p>
<p>Error rate: variable resolution failures (&lt;0.1%), publish
rollbacks (&lt;1% of publishes).</p>
<p>Localization quality (Phase 2): language QA score; bounce rates by
locale.</p>
<p>O) Telemetry (Docs &amp; Comms)</p>
<p>cms.template.create/update/publish/rollback (type=legal|comms, scope,
actor)</p>
<p>cms.clause.create/deprecate • cms.variable.add/remove</p>

(validation)</p>
<p>P) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.10 FINAL)</p>
<p>Clause library with conditions; typed variable catalog with
validation and previews.</p>
<p>Template editor with diff, impact preview, approvals, scoped publish,
schedule &amp; rollback.</p>
<p>SOW generator (roleaware, LBGaware) including deliverables, license,
travel/overtime, cancellation summary.</p>
<p>Releases (18+ enforced) and IP/license addenda; esign capture; PDFs
hashed and linked to bookings/receipts.</p>
<p>House Rules packs with deposit clauses; neighborhood privacy; studio
evidence checklist.</p>
<p>Support macros &amp; appeal templates with tone guard and
variables.</p>
<p>Email/SMS CMS with A/B variants, quiet hours, unsubscribe compliance;
transactional never suppressed.</p>
<p>Integrations to Checkout, Messaging, Receipts, Disputes, Promotions;
pinned document versions by booking.</p>
<p>Governance: owners, change windows, audits, legal approvals
enforced.</p>
<p>Metrics &amp; telemetry dashboards for adoption, disputes
defensibility, comms performance.</p>
<p>Q) Why this works</p>
<p>Opsspeed changes without code keep docs and comms aligned with live
policy and city conditions.</p>
<p>Pinned, signed, and hashed records raise trust and win
disputes/chargebacks.</p>
<p>Role and cityaware assembly means one source supports many scenarios,
cleanly.</p>
<p>Guardrails &amp; approvals prevent risky edits from slipping into
production.</p>
<p>§4.14.11 — Studios Ops</p>
<p>Goal: Operate the studio side of the marketplace without code
changes: verify studios, enforce House Rules &amp; deposits, manage
coverage by neighborhood, keep checkin smooth and safe, and tie studios
cleanly into LBG (Linked Booking Group) flows with talent—while
preserving SFW standards and strong audit trails.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Studios Ops (lead), Trust &amp; Safety, City Ops,
Support, Finance, Content Moderation, Readonly Auditor.<br />
What it controls: studio onboarding &amp; verification, listing
standards, amenities taxonomy, House Rules packs, deposit defaults &amp;
captures, access/“lockout” handling, safety &amp; compliance fields,
visibility in search/featured, coverage heatmaps, and LBG ties.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>“Studio Verified” badge requires documentation + photo checks;
twoperson approval to revoke badges or capture deposits &gt; cap
(§4.14.6).</p>
<p>No explicit sets; previews must remain SFW (enforced via
§4.14.4).</p>
<p>Address privacy: exact address never public preconfirmation;
neighborhood shown until accept.</p>
<p>B) Studio Onboarding &amp; Verification</p>
<p>Onboarding checklist (adminconfigurable in §4.14.10):</p>
<p>Identity &amp; ownership (choose 1+): lease/utility bill, business
registration, or property manager letter.</p>
<p>Address proof: document + GPSstamped photos (entrance, main room, key
amenities).</p>
<p>Minimum photos (≥12): wide + detail shots; safety items (first aid,
exits) included.</p>
<p>House Rules pack applied (from CMS) with required fields (access,
occupancy, noise, hazards).</p>
<p>Deposits setting (optional): % + cap (defaults from §4.14.2).</p>
<p>Safety &amp; compliance fields: smoke detectors, fire extinguishers,
ADA access, elevators/stairs, parking, neighborhood notes.</p>
<p>Contact method for dayof (masked relay); optional codelock provider
field (logs may be uploaded).</p>
<p>Verification console actions:</p>
<p>Approve / Request changes / Reject (with reasons &amp; examples).</p>
<p>Badge: Studio Verified; badge expires on reverify cadence (12–18
mo).</p>
<p>Reverify queue with reminder emails, autodowngrade if overdue.</p>
<p>C) Listing Standards &amp; Amenity Taxonomy</p>
<p>Amenity taxonomy (managed in §4.14.2): cyclorama, natural light,
blackout, sound treatment, dressing room, kitchenette, showers, parking,
freight elevator, seamless paper, Cstands, strobes, modifiers,
backdrops, props.<br />
Blacklisted amenities/rules: hidden cameras, explicit/sexual sets,
escorting/solicitation, dangerous stunts without licensed supervision,
weapons, pyrotechnics (unless permitted), smoking indoors (unless
ventilation + permit), offplatform payment instructions.<br />
Photo guidelines: no explicit imagery; show space, not people in
sexualized poses; watermarks permitted but unobtrusive.</p>
<p>Moderation: studio listings flow through §4.14.4 queues;
misrepresentation → strike ladder (§4.14.3) and delist until
corrected.</p>
<p>D) House Rules Packs &amp; Safety Addenda (CMSdriven)</p>
<p>House Rules templates (cityaware): access windows, quiet hours,
occupancy cap, gear usage, cleanup, alcohol/drugs, pets, minors on set,
chaperone policy, privacy areas, changing area rules.</p>
<p>Safety Addenda (optional): ladders/rigging rules, fog/haze
restrictions, electrical load limits, mandatory COI for certain
rigs.</p>
<p>Autoinsert clauses based on amenities (e.g., cyc wall → no
shoes/scuffs; haze → detectors policy).</p>
<p>City addenda (noise ordinances, loading zones) appended
automatically.</p>
<p>E) Deposits &amp; Damage Claims (with Finance integration)</p>
<p>Defaults (config in §4.14.2):</p>
<p>studio.deposit.default_pct (e.g., 20%); studio.deposit.cap_money
(e.g., $250); auth expiry (e.g., 7 days).</p>
<p>Cleaning fee min (e.g., $25) and overtime rate rules (per 30min
increments).</p>
<p>Operations:</p>
<p>Hold at checkout (separate from GMV); visible in receipts
(§4.12).</p>
<p>Claim flow: host uploads timestamped photos + rule reference →
Deposit Claim Calculator suggests capture amount (§4.14.5).</p>
<p>Capture/void/release managed in Finance (§4.14.6); &gt; cap or &gt;
$1k needs dual approval; separate deposit receipt emitted.</p>
<p>Edge cases:</p>
<p>Auth expiring in 24h → alert host + Support; bulk void tool (§4.14.6
runbooks).</p>
<p>Disputed capture → Neutral Review (§4.14.5) with evidence pack.</p>
<p>F) Access Management &amp; Lockout Handling</p>
<p>Access types: onsite host, code lock, concierge checkin, key pickup;
captured in House Rules.</p>
<p>Lockout signals: repeated code failures, buyer “at door” SOS, phone
relay unanswered.</p>
<p>Playbook: verify instructions sent → check code validity (if logs
provided) → if host fault, refund path + deposit void; if buyer fault,
apply policy bands.</p>
<p>Relocation: surface city’s backup studio list; goodwill credit within
caps (§4.14.2).</p>
<p>G) Availability, Pricing &amp; Visibility Controls</p>
<p>Admin knobs (no code):</p>
<p>Minimum booking duration (e.g., 2h), starttime increments
(15/30/60m), max party size.</p>
<p>Overtime billing rule (per 15/30/60m, grace period).</p>
<p>Cleaning fee band and “reset time” between bookings.</p>
<p>Visibility tier: Verified only appears in “Studio selector” at
checkout; unverified can exist but rank lower or require manual
approval.</p>
<p>Featured eligibility (per §4.14.8) and weekly price ladder by
city×role.</p>
<p>Search facet toggles: amenities, district/neighborhood, natural
light, sound treatment, max occupancy, deposit required.</p>
<p>H) LBG (Linked Booking Group) TieIns</p>
<p>Studio + Talent legs autogrouped for cart/checkout; each has its own
SOW/House Rules and receipts but a Group receipt summarizes both
(§4.12).</p>
<p>Change orders allow moving one leg while warning if the other
conflicts; conflict resolution wizard proposes nearest alternatives.</p>
<p>Disputes are legscoped; refund one leg without touching the other;
Support calculators handle prorates (§4.14.5).</p>
<p>I) Studio Seeding &amp; Coverage (with City Ops)</p>
<p>Coverage heatmap: neighborhoods with bookings vs demand; targets
defined in §4.14.9.</p>
<p>Outreach tools: import local studio lists; template packs for
invitations (discounted Featured, verification subsidies).</p>
<p>Quality gates: require Studio Verified for carousel placement;
deposit defaults autoapplied.</p>
<p>J) Compliance &amp; Insurance (lighttouch)</p>
<p>COI upload field (optional/required based on amenity—e.g., aerial
rigs); expiry tracking; reminder 30 days prior.</p>
<p>Local regulations: note fields for special permits (fire, drone,
alcohol); checklist acknowledges compliance.</p>
<p>Underage protections: if minors allowed by House Rules, enforce
chaperone clause and IDverified guardian signature.</p>
<p>K) Support &amp; Safety Integrations</p>
<p>Access failures autoopen Support case (P1) with House Rules and code
logs attached (§4.14.5).</p>
<p>Unsafe conditions reports route to T&amp;S; delist until fixes
verified (§4.14.3).</p>
<p>Moderation: listing images/text scanned per §4.14.4; explicit sets
blocked; appeals possible.</p>
<p>L) Metrics &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>KPIs</p>
<p>Verification coverage (# Verified Studios, % of studio supply).</p>
<p>Access failure rate (per 100 bookings), deposit claim rate &amp; win
%.</p>
<p>Dispute rate (studio leg) and time to resolve.</p>
<p>Utilization: hours booked / hours available; overtime incidence.</p>
<p>Image quality pass rate at moderation; COI validity %.</p>
<p>Coverage by neighborhood vs target (green/yellow/red).</p>
<p>Alerts</p>
<p>Lockouts &gt; threshold/day; deposit auths expiring &gt; threshold;
COI expiring in ≤30 days; neighborhood coverage gaps; repeated unsafe
condition reports.</p>
<p>M) Telemetry (Studios Ops)</p>

<p>N) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.11 FINAL)</p>
<p>Onboarding &amp; verification flow with evidence, GPSstamped photos,
House Rules packs, and badge issuance/reverify cadence.</p>
<p>Amenity taxonomy and blacklist enforced; listing photos moderated for
SFW previews.</p>
<p>Deposits configured per city; holds at checkout; claim flow with
evidence and calculator; captures/voids in Finance.</p>
<p>Access &amp; lockout playbooks with relocation option and goodwill
credits within caps.</p>
<p>Availability/pricing knobs (min duration, increments, overtime,
cleaning fee); visibility tiering and search facets.</p>
<p>LBG support: group checkout, legscoped disputes, group receipt,
conflict wizard.</p>
<p>Compliance fields (COI, permits); reminder system for expiries.</p>
<p>City coverage heatmap &amp; seeding hooks; Featured eligibility
integration.</p>
<p>Metrics, alerts, telemetry dashboards live; audit trails for all
actions.</p>
<p>O) Why this works</p>
<p>Trustable supply (verified, documented, SFW) that plugs directly into
your booking, dispute, and finance rails.</p>
<p>Smooth dayof operations (clear House Rules, access, deposits) cut
Support load and refunds.</p>
<p>City growth ready with coverage targets, seeding tools, and fair
visibility.</p>
<p>Nocode adjustments keep you nimble as you scale studios alongside
talent.</p>
<p>§4.14.12 — Data &amp; Reporting (Admin UI)</p>
<p>Goal: Give nonengineering teams one place to see how the marketplace
is performing, diagnose issues, and act—without raw SQL. Dashboards are
curated, LBGaware, privacysafe, and tie back to exact definitions in a
shared metric catalog. Exports and alerts are scheduled, and everything
is auditable. (Section 5 will specify the data warehouse schema &amp;
event contracts.)</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Execs, City Ops, Marketing/Promotions, Trust &amp;
Safety, Content Moderation, Support, Finance/Tax, Studios Ops,
Product.<br />
What it covers: Curated dashboards, drilldowns, cohorting/segmentation,
scheduled reports, anomaly alerts, CSV/JSON exports.<br />
Guardrails:</p>
<p>RBAC mirrors §4.14.1 (Admin Security).</p>
<p>PII masked by default; unmask requires scope + reason.</p>
<p>LBG vs leg metrics are clearly labeled.</p>
<p>All numbers show definition tooltips linking to the Metric
Catalog.</p>
<p>B) Metric Catalog (sourceoftruth)</p>
<p>Catalog entries include: name, owner, business definition, SQL/logic
hash, event sources, time grain, inclusions/exclusions, and
version.<br />
Examples</p>
<p>gmv_total (LBG sum, excludes deposits; refunds netted)</p>
<p>bookings_count (LBG count; includes completed &amp; accepted
scheduled)</p>

<p>Governance</p>
<p>Every dashboard tile references a catalog key with version (e.g.,
take_rate_net@v2).</p>
<p>Changes trigger deprecation windows and “what changed?” diffs.</p>
<p>C) Data Freshness &amp; Reliability</p>
<p>Freshness badges on every page: “Updated 8 min ago” with SLA:
nearrealtime (≤15 min) for ops; daily for monthend finance.</p>
<p>Backfill indicators when a replay job is running; “partial” banner on
affected tiles.</p>
<p>Data Quality checks: completeness, duplicate event ratios,
referential integrity (e.g., booking has a city &amp; role), schema
drift alarms.</p>
<p>D) Dashboard Library (curated)</p>
<p>D1. Marketplace Health (Companywide)</p>
<p>Lighthouse tiles (last 7/28/90): GMV (LBG), Bookings (LBG), Net
Takerate, Active Supply by role, Verified %, IB share, Inquiry→Booking
%, Repeat booking %, CSAT, NPS, Safety incidents /1k, Chargeback rate
&amp; win %, Invalid click rate.</p>
<p>Trends: by city &amp; role; stacked time series with YoY/DoW
controls.</p>
<p>Drilldowns: click GMV → city→role → provider decile → booking
list.</p>
<p>D2. City Ops Dashboard</p>
<p>Targets vs actuals (from §4.14.9): supply targets, ratios, verified
coverage, response time median, IB share, studio coverage heatmap.</p>
<p>Alerts panel: gaps, overconcentration, budget burn.</p>
<p>Actions: jump links to cohort builder or playbooks.</p>
<p>D3. Growth &amp; Activation</p>
<p>Funnel: Invite → Signup → ID Verify → Publish packages → First
booking → Second booking (retention).</p>
<p>Split by role, city, and acquisition channel.</p>
<p>Cohorts: weekly signup cohorts; time to first booking; weekoverweek
retention.</p>
<p>D4. Search &amp; Conversion</p>
<p>Searches, result CTR, contact rate, inquiry→booking rate by
role/city.</p>
<p>Ranking diagnostics: distribution by distance/price/rep; effect of

<p>D8. Support &amp; Disputes (§4.14.5)</p>
<p>Case volume by type; SLA adherence; outcome mix; refund rate; quality
disputes split (subjective/objective).</p>
<p>Chargebacks: opened, represented, win %; liability $.</p>
<p>Goodwill credits issued vs caps; selfserve resolution %.</p>
<p>D9. Finance &amp; Payouts (§4.14.6)</p>
<p>Net takerate, processor cost %, payout failure rate, reserves
coverage, Early Payout usage &amp; yield.</p>

neighborhood.</p>
<p>D12. Product &amp; A/B Experiments</p>
<p>Experiment list with lift metrics (conversion, ROAS, responsetime);
guardrail breaches; sample ratio mismatch checks.</p>
<p>E) Filters, Segments &amp; Cohorts</p>
<p>Global filters across dashboards: date range, city/state, role,
device type, Safe Mode (on/off exposure), verification tier, Rep decile,
acquisition channel, campaign.<br />
Segments: new vs returning, Verified vs unverified, Trusted Pro vs not,
IB on/off, social deciles (IG/TT/YT/X), price band.<br />
Cohorts: weekly signup cohort; firstbooking cohort; citylaunch cohort;
provider deciles by activity.</p>
<p>F) Drilldowns &amp; Detail Views</p>
<p>From tile → detail (e.g., click “Chargeback loss $” → list of cases
with links to evidence packs).</p>
<p>From promotions → providerlevel ROAS &amp; CPB; click to open their
campaign settings.</p>
<p>From city ratios → list of providers to invite (prefilled filters) or
studios to outreach.</p>
<p>G) Exports &amp; Scheduling</p>
<p>Oneclick CSV/JSON for tables; parquet for large extracts (warehouse
path).</p>
<p>Scheduled reports (email/Slack) with attachments or links: daily
health, weekly city ops, promos ROAS, safety SLA, finance recon, tax
filings due, support SLAs.</p>
<p>Access control: report subscriptions require RBAC role; PII masked
unless scope granted.</p>
<p>Run logs: success/failure; retry with backoff; recipients list.</p>
<p>H) Alerts &amp; Anomaly Detection</p>
<p>Rules (editable via §4.14.2)</p>
<p>Takerate drops &gt; 100 bps DoD in any city</p>
<p>Inquiry→Booking dips &lt; 25% for &gt; 24h in a city</p>
<p>Invalid click rate &gt; 10% for any provider dayoverday</p>
<p>Safety P0 count ≥ 3 in 24h in a city</p>
<p>Tax calc error rate &gt; 1% in any state</p>
<p>Payout failure rate &gt; 0.5% daily</p>
<p>Moderation removal spike &gt; 3× baseline houroverhour</p>
<p>Destinations: Slack channels (teamspecific) and email; each alert
links to the dashboard deeplink and relevant admin tool.</p>
<p>I) Privacy, PII &amp; SafeMode Display</p>
<p>PII masking by default; unmask requires scope + reason; downloads
watermark the requester.</p>
<p>SFW previews only (no explicit thumbnails in dashboards).</p>
<p>Aggregation thresholds: hide tiles for cohorts &lt; N to avoid
reidentification.</p>
<p>GDPR/CCPA hooks: (futureproof) report excludes deleted/anonymized
users.</p>
<p>J) LBG vs Leg Accounting</p>
<p>Toggle: “View as LBG” (grouped) vs “View legs” (talent/studio
separate).</p>
<p>KPIs indicate which base is used (badge: LBG SUM or LEG SUM).</p>
<p>Exports include both views with join keys.</p>
<p>K) Admin UI Patterns</p>
<p>Tile glossary: hover → definition, owner, metric key, last changed,
link to catalog.</p>
<p>Compare mode: select two cities or two periods; shows % change and
confidence bands.</p>
<p>Saved views: peruser saved filter sets; share links with
teammates.</p>
<p>Notes: add annotations (“Houston buyerfee holiday started here”).</p>
<p>L) Integrations &amp; Links</p>
<p>Deep links to §4.14.8 (Promotions floors, QS), §4.14.9 (City
playbooks), §4.14.5 (open case), §4.14.6 (finance event), §4.14.7 (nexus
switch), §4.14.10 (edit template).</p>
<p>Warehouse: every tile shows the dataset table/view powering it; “Open
in warehouse” (readonly for Analysts).</p>
<p>M) Metrics &amp; Quality Ops</p>
<p>Data QA dashboard: event drop rates, late arrivals, schema errors,
backfill status.</p>
<p>Reconciliation: GMV per dashboard vs finance exports; discrepancy
tile with thresholds.</p>
<p>Ownership: each dashboard has an owner and oncall rotation for data
quality.</p>
<p>N) Telemetry (Data UI)</p>
<p>data.dashboard.view (name) • data.tile.click (metric_key)</p>
<p>data.filter.apply • data.export.run (scope, rows) •
data.schedule.create/run/fail</p>
<p>data.alert.fire/ack/resolve (rule_id)</p>
<p>data.metric.version.change (key, old→new)</p>
<p>data.drilldown.open (entity_type) • data.deep_link.out</p>
<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.12 FINAL)</p>
<p>Metric Catalog exists; every tile references a catalog key+version
with definition tooltip.</p>
<p>Freshness badges, backfill banners, and data quality checks present
on all dashboards.</p>
<p>Curated dashboards for Marketplace, City Ops, Growth, Search &amp;
Conversion, Promotions, T&amp;S, Moderation, Support, Finance, Tax,
Studios, Experiments.</p>
<p>Filters/segments/cohorts work globally; cohort retention and funnel
views implemented.</p>
<p>Drilldowns to entities/cases; deep links into admin tools.</p>
<p>Exports (CSV/JSON/parquet) and scheduled reports (email/Slack) with
RBAC &amp; masking.</p>
<p>Alerts and anomaly rules configurable; fire to Slack/email with
dashboard links.</p>
<p>PII/SafeMode protections: masking, aggregation thresholds, SFW
previews, watermarking.</p>
<p>LBG vs leg toggle implemented; labeled KPIs and exports.</p>
<p>Telemetry events and data QA dashboards live; owner per dashboard
assigned.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Puts the right numbers in front of each team with shared definitions,
so decisions are aligned.</p>
<p>Nearrealtime ops plus monthend depth covers both daily steering and
financial truth.</p>
<p>Privacysafe and actionlinked (deep links) means insights turn into
changes quickly.</p>
<p>Versioned metrics keep trust high even as we refine logic.</p>
<p>§4.14.13 — Observability &amp; Incident Response</p>
<p>Goal: Detect issues early, respond fast, and recover safely—without
exposing PII or requiring code changes. Provide a unified status
cockpit, clear SLOs/alerts, oneclick degradations/kill switches, tested
runbooks, disciplined postmortems, and links into every admin tool that
matters.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: OnCall (Product/Platform), SRE/Ops, City Ops (read),
Support Leads, Trust &amp; Safety Leads, Finance (payout incidents),
Legal (for P0 comms approvals).<br />
What it covers: service health, dependency health, synthetic checks,
error budgets, alerts &amp; paging, incident command, comms,
degradations/killswitches (from §4.14.2), runbooks, postmortems, and
status page publishing.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>Paging thresholds &amp; killswitches are configdriven (see §4.14.2)
with twoperson approval for money/safety toggles.</p>
<p>PIIsafe logs only; sensitive views still respect §4.14.1 scopes.</p>
<p>B) SLOs, SLIs &amp; Error Budgets</p>
<p>Toplevel SLOs (Prod, monthly):</p>
<p>Checkout success (card/ACH): ≥ 99.5% 2xx within p95 latency ≤
2.5s.</p>
<p>Booking create/accept: ≥ 99.7% success, p95 ≤ 1.5s.</p>
<p>Search: p95 ≤ 800ms, 99.9% availability.</p>
<p>Payout queue: ≥ 99% of eligible payouts queued within 2h of
completion; failure rate &lt; 0.5%.</p>
<p>Uploads &amp; moderation pipeline: 99% of images/videos scanned
within 60s; backlog &lt; 2k items.</p>
<p>Tax calc: p95 ≤ 1.5s; exception rate &lt; 0.5%.</p>
<p>Promotions delivery: spend pacing error &lt; 5% daily; invalid click
falsenegative rate &lt; 2%.</p>
<p>SLIs monitored: success rate, latency p50/p95/p99, saturation (queue
depth, CPU/mem), dependency errors, synthetic check pass rate, error
budget burn (1h/6h/24h).</p>
<p>C) Health Cockpit (Admin → Observability)</p>
<p>Status board tiles: API, Search, Checkout (Card/ACH), Escrow,
Payouts, Promotions, Uploads/Moderation, Tax Engine, Background Check,
Studio Deposits, Messaging, Notifications.<br />
Each tile shows current SLI/SLO, trend sparkline, errorbudget burn, and
degrade/kill buttons (where safe).<br />
Dependency pane: external provider status ingest; shows current
incidents &amp; ETA.</p>
<p>Synthetic monitors:</p>
<p>Buyer path: search → profile → add to cart → checkout (card/ACH) →
receipt.</p>
<p>Seller path: accept → deliverables upload → acceptance.</p>
<p>Studio path: calendar → checkout with deposit hold.<br />
Runs per city (Houston focus + 3 canaries) every minute.</p>
<p>D) Alerting Policy &amp; Paging</p>
<p>Severities</p>
<p>S0 (P0): Platformwide checkout failure, data loss risk, security
breach → page immediately (phone/SMS/Slack) to OnCall + Incident
Commander (IC).</p>
<p>S1 (P1): Degraded key flow in any city (e.g., Houston), payout stall,
tax calc outage, promotions overspend → page OnCall.</p>
<p>S2: Elevated error or latency with autoretries; backlog growth;
single dependency degraded → Slack alert to channel; acknowledge within
30 min.</p>
<p>S3: Nonurgent anomalies &amp; dataquality drifts → daily digest.</p>
<p>Threshold examples (editable in §4.14.2):</p>
<p>Checkout success &lt; 98.5% 10min window (S1); &lt; 95% 5min
(S0).</p>
<p>Tax exceptions &gt; 2% 15min (S1).</p>
<p>Payout failures &gt; 1% 30min (S1).</p>
<p>Promotions spend pacing &gt; +10% houroverhour (S1).</p>
<p>Upload backlog &gt; 5k or scan p95 &gt; 120s (S2).</p>
<p>Escalation: IC assigns Ops Lead, Comms/Scribe, and Resolver; if no
ack in 5 min, escalate to secondary.</p>
<p>E) Incident Lifecycle (declare → close)</p>
<p>Detect (monitor or report) → Declare severity &amp; IC in the
tool.</p>
<p>Stabilize: apply degradation/kill switches (see G), raise banners,
slow traffic if needed, open support macro.</p>
<p>Communicate: internal incident room; post to public status page if
S0/S1; cadence every 30–60 min until resolved.</p>
<p>Mitigate &amp; validate: rollbacks, feature flag flips, traffic
shifting, provider fallback.</p>
<p>Resolve: all SLIs normal; remove banners; undegrade; mark
“Resolved”.</p>
<p>Postmortem: within 5 business days—blameless, action items with
owners/deadlines.</p>
<p>Comms templates (from §4.14.10): internal alert, stakeholder update,
public status page incident, “all clear.”</p>
<p>F) Degradations &amp; Kill Switches (oneclick)</p>
<p>Degrade (preferred) before kill: keeps core value flowing.</p>
<p>Checkout: disable ACH (fallback to card; buyer fee reverts to 5%);
disable multileg/LBG (separate flows) if grouping breaks.</p>
<p>Promotions: pause Featured, keep CPC with stricter caps; or pause all
paid Boosts.</p>
<p>Tax: grace mode—block checkout with clear retry banner (failclosed
for money safety) or delay acceptance with “tax pending” flag
(adminapproved only).</p>
<p>Uploads: switch to queueonly (no preview generation) and lengthen
moderation SLA; throttle size per file.</p>
<p>Payouts: enqueue only, delay send with banner; communicate ETAs to
sellers.</p>
<p>Background checks: switch to IDonly gating temporarily; queue
requests.</p>
<p>Studio deposits: disable new auths (fallback to cleaning fee) if PSP
deposit path fails.</p>
<p>Kill switches (hard off; see §4.14.2): Instant Book, Promotions, LBG,
ACH, Deposits, Safe Mode stricton. All require reason + twoperson
approval for money/safety.</p>
<p>G) Runbooks (top 12)</p>
<p>Card processor incident → route to fallback region; if full outage:
block checkout with banner; open S0; ACH off; autoretry queue.</p>
<p>ACH/Bank link outage → kill ACH; buyer fee back to 5%; announce;
reenable when synthetic passes 30 min.</p>
<p>Tax engine down → enable tax grace mode; hold checkouts or delay
acceptance (policy); alert Finance; reprice none.</p>
<p>Payouts failing → freeze sends; display “payout delayed” in UI; retry
after root cause; notify sellers.</p>
<p>Search index degraded → fall back to cached results/top N; disable
advanced filters; rebuild offline.</p>
<p>Uploads S3/CDN issue → switch to reduced image sizes; queue video;
show “processing longer than usual.”</p>
<p>Moderation classifier offline → enforce SFW blur defaults;
premoderate first N items; ramp back after checks.</p>
<p>Promotions overspend anomaly → immediate CPC cap; pause Featured;
credit wallet for overdelivery; rootcause invalid clicks.</p>
<p>Spam/abuse wave → tighten DM caps; block offplatform keywords;
autoquarantine new accounts; T&amp;S mass actions.</p>
<p>Studio lockout spike → open city relocation list; goodwill credit
budget; contact affected bookings.</p>
<p>Feature flag misconfig → oneclick rollback to last known good; diff
viewer; require approver notes.</p>
<p>Data pipeline delay → show “partial” freshness banner; queue
scheduled reports; notify dashboard users.</p>
<p>Each runbook includes: owner, steps, rollback, comms template,
postincident checks.</p>
<p>H) Change Management &amp; Safeguards</p>
<p>Staged rollout for risky configs (1%→10%→50%→100%); autoabort on
guardrail breach (conversion, checkout, error rate).</p>
<p>Release freeze windows (city launches, holidays).</p>
<p>Preprod synthetic runs parallel to Prod.</p>
<p>Canaries: mirror 1–5% traffic.</p>
<p>Autorollback if error budget 1h burn exceeds threshold.</p>
<p>I) Logging, Tracing &amp; PII Hygiene</p>
<p>Structured logs with request_id, booking_id, city, role; no plaintext
PII (emails, phones, TINs) ever logged; use tokens only.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing across services; trace viewer limited to Admin
roles; sampling adjustable during incidents.</p>
<p>Retention: app logs 14–30 days; security/finance events 1–3 years
(per policy).</p>
<p>Access: masked views by default; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes +
reason.</p>
<p>J) Backups, Recovery &amp; Continuity</p>
<p>RPO/RTO targets: RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 2 h for critical data
stores.</p>
<p>Backups: pointintime for primary DB; object storage with lifecycle;
daily job integrity checks; quarterly restore drills.</p>
<p>Event replay: appendonly event bus; replay tools to rebuild search
indexes, counters, and derived aggregates.</p>
<p>External links manifest (deliverables): names/sizes/hashes enable
dispute handling even if thirdparty storage hiccups.</p>
<p>K) Public Status Page &amp; Comms</p>
<p>Components: API, Checkout, Payouts, Search, Uploads/Media,
Promotions, Tax Engine, Background Checks, Studio Deposits.</p>
<p>Incident workflow: draft → Legal quick review for S0 “wording” →
publish; cadence every 30–60 min; “resolved” with root cause summary and
next steps.</p>
<p>Subscribe: email/RSS.</p>
<p>Transparency guardrails: never include PII; keep copy SFW.</p>
<p>L) Postmortems (Blameless)</p>
<p>Trigger: any S0, or S1 &gt; 30 min, or repeat S2 within 7 days.</p>
<p>Structure: what/impact/timeline/where we were blind/root
cause(s)/what helped/hurt/fixes/owners/dates; link to diffs &amp; flags;
attach dashboards.</p>
<p>Action tracking: owners &amp; due dates; reminders; escalation if
overdue.</p>
<p>Learning loop: update runbooks/alerts/guardrails; review in weekly
ops.</p>
<p>M) Metrics &amp; Alerts (Observability Program)</p>
<p>MTTD/MTTR (by severity), % incidents detected by monitors vs user
reports (target &gt; 80% monitors).</p>
<p>Error budget used per SLO; number of autorollbacks; changefailure
rate; paging fatigue (alerts/week/engineer).</p>
<p>Runbook coverage: incidents with matching runbook; time to first
mitigation.</p>
<p>Comms: time from declare → first status page update.</p>
<p>N) Telemetry (Obs &amp; Incidents)</p>
<p>obs.sli.update (name, value, slo_target) • obs.error_budget.burn</p>
<p>incident.declare (sev, ic, reason) • incident.page/ack/escalate</p>
<p>incident.degrade.on/off (flag) • incident.kill.on/off (flag)</p>
<p>incident.status.update (public|internal) • incident.resolve</p>
<p>postmortem.create/publish • runbook.open/complete</p>
<p>obs.alert.fire/ack/resolve (rule_id) • obs.synthetic.fail/pass</p>
<p>O) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.13 FINAL)</p>
<p>Status cockpit with SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, dependency health, and
oneclick degradations/kill switches.</p>
<p>Alerting policy with severities, thresholds, paging &amp; escalation;
editable via §4.14.2.</p>
<p>Incident workflow (IC assignment, roles, comms cadence, banners,
status page publishing).</p>
<p>Runbooks for top 12 scenarios; linked buttons in cockpit; tested
quarterly.</p>
<p>Change safeguards: staged rollout, guardrails, autorollback; freeze
windows.</p>
<p>PIIsafe logging &amp; tracing with RBAC; retention policies
applied.</p>
<p>Backups &amp; restore drills meeting RPO/RTO; event replay tools.</p>
<p>Postmortems with action tracking; program metrics &amp; quarterly
review.</p>
<p>Telemetry events emitted; dashboards for MTTD/MTTR, alert volumes,
error budgets.</p>
<p>P) Why this works</p>
<p>Find fast, fix fast: crisp SLOs and a cockpit that puts degradations
and runbooks one click away.</p>
<p>Safe by design: money/safety toggles require approvals; PII never
leaks; comms stay clear and SFW.</p>
<p>Continuous learning: postmortems feed runbooks and guardrails so
incidents trend down as the platform scales.</p>
<p>§4.14.14 — Bulk Tools &amp; Migrations</p>
<p>Goal: Give Ops/Support/Finance the power to make large, safe,
reversible changes—without code. Handle duplicates, reindexing, citywide
policy rollouts, mass refunds/credits, campaign adjustments,
board/content moves, and backfills with dryruns, guardrails, approvals,
scheduling, and audit trails. LBGaware, moneysafe, privacysafe.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Super Admin (rare), Ops Leads, Support Leads, Finance,
City Ops, Trust &amp; Safety (specific flows), Content Moderation
(specific flows), Readonly Auditor.</p>
<p>What it can change (entity families):</p>
<p>Users &amp; Accounts (merge, role/profile reparenting, verification
status sync)</p>
<p>Bookings &amp; LBGs (link/unlink legs, acceptance window extensions,
deliverables due date shifts)</p>
<p>Money Objects (bulk refunds/credits/fee adjustments with amended
receipts)</p>
<p>Promotions (boost/featured campaigns: pause/price floor align, budget
edits)</p>
<p>Search/Index &amp; Social Metrics (reindex, backfill, recalc Rep,
resync social metrics)</p>
<p>Boards &amp; Content (move/retag favorites, reassign tagged
collaborators)</p>
<p>Studios (policy parameter updates: deposits, cleaning fees, min
durations)</p>
<p>Policy Attachments (SOW/release/House Rules addenda to
future/affected bookings)</p>
<p>Guardrails (always on):</p>
<p>Twoperson approval for money, safety, PIIsensitive, or irreversible
actions.</p>
<p>Dryrun + blastradius preview with sample rows required.</p>
<p>Chunked execution, idempotency keys, resume on failure.</p>
<p>Autogenerate rollback plan (where feasible) + snapshots.</p>
<p>Mask PII in previews; unmask gated by §4.14.1 scopes.</p>
<p>B) Common Bulk Job Flow (wizard)</p>
<p>Select Operation → entity family + action (see sections below).</p>
<p>Define Target Set → filters (city, role, date range, status,
verification, Rep decile, campaign status, etc.) + optional CSV list
(IDs/emails).</p>
<p>DryRun &amp; Preview → show count, 50row sample (before/after),
impacted KPIs (e.g., total refund $), dependency checks (e.g., open
disputes?).</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Guardrails → flags needed (MoneyCritical, SafetyCritical),
limits (max $/booking, max $ total, max rows).</p>
<p>Schedule &amp; Pace → start/end window (local city TZ), batch size,
interbatch delay, offpeak default.</p>
<p>Approvals → second approver with diff viewer.</p>
<p>Execute &amp; Monitor → progress bar, perbatch logs, error bucket
with retry.</p>
<p>Notify (optional) → attach Smart Docs/Comms templates (§4.14.10) to
inform impacted users.</p>
<p>Rollback (if supported) → oneclick create inverse job template
prefilled from snapshot.</p>
<p>Job record includes: actor, reason code, linked ticket, scopes,
filters, dryrun snapshot hash, approvals, schedule, outcome stats, CSV
of affected IDs (downloadable, masked).</p>
<p>C) Users &amp; Accounts — Merge &amp; Normalize</p>
<p>Use cases: duplicate signups (email + social), creator with split
role accounts, brand team consolidation.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>LinkandHold (soft stage, reversible 7 days): mark profiles as
aliases; both URLs redirect to a canonical; present “pending merge”
banner in Admin; no data is moved yet.</p>
<p>Finalize Merge (irreversible): unify login identities, verifications
(highest wins with audit), W9/TIN (prompt to pick primary; alternate
archived), payout method (choose primary), portfolios (dedupe media via
hash), reviews (union), Rep score (recompute with decay), DM threads
(reassign to canonical), promotions wallets (sum balances), boards
(union).</p>
<p>Role/Profile Reparent: move a service profile (e.g., Photographer)
from user A to user B (rare; requires proof + approvals).</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>Twoperson approval; no ongoing payout/chargeback on either account;
no active safety cases.</p>
<p>Rollback: only from LinkandHold. After Finalize, a reversal = new
merge job in opposite direction not allowed (must escalate to
engineering).</p>
<p>Comms: notify both emails; require reauth next login.</p>
<p>D) Bookings &amp; LBG — Relate, Retime, Addenda</p>
<p>Use cases: early legs created separately need grouping; acceptance
window policy changed; stormrelated deliverables extension.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Link to LBG: select talent/studio bookings within same buyer + window
→ create Group; generate Group Receipt (§4.12).</p>
<p>Unlink leg (rare): leg removed from LBG (keeps its receipts);
requires Support case link.</p>
<p>Acceptance Window Extend: push acceptance due date by N days on open
bookings (config max).</p>
<p>Deliverables Due Shift: move due dates; optional autoaddendum via
Smart Docs; both parties notified.</p>
<p>Policy Addendum: attach a SOW/House Rules addendum to future or open
bookings; requires reaccept in thread.</p>
<p>Guardrails: no money lines altered unless paired with Change Order;
respect city policy keys (§4.14.2); log all changes &amp; notify.</p>
<p>E) Money — Safe Bulk Refunds / Credits / Fee Fixes</p>
<p>Use cases: processor outage partial refunds, tax miscalc in one
state/day, goodwill credit wave after access failures.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Refunds (partial/full): reasoncoded; perline (packages, addons,
travel, license); recompute fees/taxes; issue amended receipts
(§4.12).</p>
<p>Credits (platform wallet): city/role scoped; expirations; ledger post
(§4.14.6).</p>
<p>Fee Adjustment (rare): buyer or provider fee correction for window;
twoperson approval; bounded by floor/cap.</p>
<p>Deposit Voids (studio): mass void for auths expiring due to
outage.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>Global caps: max $ per booking, $ total, # rows; chargebackexcluded;
safety cases excluded.</p>
<p>Dual approval; dryrun shows totals; Finance visibility during
execution.</p>
<p>Rollback: credits reversible (issue offset); refunds not (issue
countercharge only with consent → avoided).</p>
<p>F) Promotions — Campaign Adjustments</p>
<p>Use cases: raise floors citywide; pause Featured during outage; align
active bids to new floors.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Pause/Resume active Boost or Featured campaigns (filters: city×role,
Rep tier, budget left).</p>
<p>Floor Alignment: if bid &lt; floor, autoraise to floor (optin);
notify providers.</p>
<p>Budget &amp; Dates: extend end dates, add makegood credits.</p>
<p>Bulk credit for invalid clicks during incident (ties into §4.14.8
wallet).</p>
<p>Guardrails: eligibility enforced; Finance ledger posts; notify
affected users (template).</p>
<p>G) Search/Index &amp; Social — Reindex, Recalc, Resync</p>
<p>Use cases: new facet weights; rep formula tweak; social API outage
recovery.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Reindex profiles/search with new §4.14.2 weights or facet toggles;
chunked by city.</p>
<p>Rep Recalc: recompute scores for selected cohorts (e.g., HOU
photographers); publish atomically.</p>
<p>Social Resync: refresh IG/TT/YT/X metrics for affected accounts
(ratelimited; respect API quotas); mark verified/unverified chips
accordingly.</p>
<p>NSFW Rescan: rerun classifier on portfolio thumbnails when threshold
changes; rewrite preview crops.</p>
<p>Guardrails: throttle; backoff on provider API limits; banner “metrics
refreshing” on profiles.</p>
<p>H) Boards &amp; Content — Move, Retag, Reassign</p>
<p>Use cases: consolidate user’s boards, fix mistagged collaborators
after merge, remove content from feeds.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Move items between boards; rename/merge boards; preserve creation
dates.</p>
<p>Retag collaborators on content to new canonical user (after merge);
send consent prompt again if needed.</p>
<p>Remove or reprivacy content in policy migrations (e.g., stricter
preview rules) with reason + appeal link.</p>
<p>Guardrails: respect collaborator consent states; moderation rules
(§4.14.4) rerun on moved items.</p>
<p>I) Studios — Policy Parameter Updates</p>
<p>Use cases: city raises default deposits; cleaning fee minima update;
min duration changes.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>Deposit %/cap updates to listings; choose: apply to new bookings only
or also to open (future) bookings via addendum + reaccept.</p>
<p>Cleaning fee minima mass set; min duration increased; starttime
increment adjusted.</p>
<p>Visibility tier: demote unverified studios from carousels.</p>
<p>Guardrails: LBGaware; generate addenda; Finance deposit holds
adjusted only on new checkouts (never silently increased on existing
bookings).</p>
<p>J) Previews, Simulation &amp; Impact Checks</p>
<p>For every job:</p>
<p>Count &amp; sample (before/after columns).</p>
<p>Impact tiles: total refunds $, # bookings affected, # users to
notify, campaigns paused, index rebuild time estimate.</p>
<p>Dependency warnings: “10 bookings have open disputes”, “5 users under
safety investigation”, “25 payouts queued”.</p>
<p>KPI simulation (when applicable): expected takerate delta, ROAS
effect range, search ranking drift.</p>
<p>K) Scheduling, Chunking &amp; Idempotency</p>
<p>Chunk size defaults (e.g., 500 users; 2,000 bookings; 10,000 index
docs).</p>
<p>Pacing: interbatch delay (e.g., 2–10s), offpeak windows
(cityaware).</p>
<p>Idempotency: each batch writes a job_id + batch_id footprint; retries
skip alreadydone rows.</p>
<p>Resume: pick up from last successful batch; Stop is safe; Requeue
failed only.</p>
<p>Rate limits: external API calls (social, PSP) throttled; exponential
backoff.</p>
<p>L) Communications (optional but recommended)</p>
<p>Attach email/SMS templates (§4.14.10) per job type (refund notice,
policy addendum, campaign pause, merge confirm).</p>
<p>Quiet hours respected; city timezone aware.</p>
<p>“Why you’re seeing this” copy autofilled with reason code and policy
link.</p>
<p>M) Data Integrity &amp; Audit</p>
<p>Snapshot prechange: affected rows (IDs, key fields) hashed and
archived.</p>
<p>Immutable job log: inputs, approvals, batches, outcomes, error
list.</p>
<p>Entity timelines updated (e.g., “Bulk refund JOB123 applied
20251104”).</p>
<p>Downloadables: CSV of results (masked), error CSV, notification
list.</p>
<p>N) Metrics &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>KPIs</p>
<p>Job success %; average retry rate; rollback rate; time to
completion.</p>
<p>Money jobs: total $ moved, variance vs preview (target &lt; 1%).</p>
<p>Index jobs: doc rebuild throughput, search latency impact.</p>
<p>Comms: open/click/complaint rate on notices.</p>
<p>Safety: user reports spike postjob (guardrail metric).</p>
<p>Alerts</p>
<p>Batch error rate &gt; threshold; preview vs actual deltas; money cap
nearing; API ratelimit stalls; search p95 &gt; SLA during reindex.</p>
<p>O) Telemetry (Bulk Ops)</p>
<p>bulk.job.create/preview/approve/schedule/start/progress/finish/fail/rollback</p>
<p>bulk.scope.resolve (counts) • bulk.sample.fetch</p>
<p>bulk.guardrail.block (reason) • bulk.approval.add</p>
<p>bulk.notify.send/fail • bulk.retry.batch</p>
<p>bulk.money.total_delta • bulk.index.docs_processed</p>
<p>bulk.rollback.create/finish</p>
<p>P) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.14 FINAL)</p>
<p>Unified Bulk Job wizard with filters, dryrun, approvals, schedule,
monitoring, rollback templates.</p>
<p>User merge with LinkandHold → Finalize;
payout/W9/TIN/payout/portfolio/reviews/DMs/boards consolidation;
redirects set; audit logged.</p>
<p>LBG tools: link/unlink legs, acceptance/delivery date shifts, addenda
attach + reaccept flow.</p>
<p>Money jobs: refunds/credits/fee fixes with caps, recomputed
fees/taxes, amended receipts, Finance ledger posts.</p>
<p>Promotions jobs: pause/resume, floor alignment, budget/date edits,
invalidclick makegoods.</p>
<p>Index &amp; metrics jobs: reindex, Rep recalc, social resync, NSFW
rescan—throttled &amp; resumable.</p>
<p>Boards/content: move/merge boards, retag collaborators, reprivacy
content with appeals links.</p>
<p>Studio policy updates: deposit %, caps, cleaning/min duration with
addenda options; no silent increases on existing bookings.</p>
<p>Scheduling/chunking/idempotency and PIIsafe previews; detailed job
logs &amp; snapshots.</p>
<p>Metrics/alerts/telemetry for success, deltas, errors, and performance
impact.</p>
<p>Q) Why this works</p>
<p>Ops speed, safely: Big changes happen during offpeak with previews,
caps, and approvals.</p>
<p>Reversible where possible: snapshots and rollback templates reduce
fear and downtime.</p>
<p>Money and policyaware: recomputes fees/taxes, issues amended
receipts, triggers addenda and reacceptance where users must opt in.</p>
<p>Scales with growth: chunked, resumable, idempotent jobs keep risk low
as data volume rises.</p>
<p>§4.14.15 — Legal &amp; Records</p>
<p>Goal: Handle subpoenas/LE requests, litigation holds, datasubject
actions, and retention/deletion safely and defensibly—with
leastprivilege access, full audit trails, reliable exports, and clear
coordination with Trust/Safety, Support, and Finance. Keep engineers out
of the loop for routine matters; make exceptional cases twoperson
approved and PIIsafe.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Legal (owner), Privacy/Compliance, Trust &amp; Safety
Leads (read/assist), Support Leads (DSR assist), Finance/Tax (view for
records), Readonly Auditor.</p>
<p>What it covers:</p>
<p>Intake &amp; verification of subpoenas, warrants, and LE requests
(USonly).</p>
<p>Case vaults and legal holds that suspend deletion/retention
timers.</p>
<p>Data retention schedules &amp; purge jobs for system records (chat,
bookings, docs, logs).</p>
<p>Data Subject Requests (DSR): access/export, deletion (where allowed),
and optout logging.</p>
<p>Clickwrap &amp; consent logs (ToS/Privacy, Edelivery).</p>
<p>Discovery exports: review sets with PII redaction and hashed
manifests.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>Twoperson approval for any data disclosure or hold release (Legal +
Privacy).</p>
<p>PII scopes enforced (see §4.14.1): only Legal role can unmask PIITax
and PIIBackground inside exports.</p>
<p>Chainofcustody hashing on every produced file.</p>
<p>Gag order awareness: suppress user notifications where order shown
and recorded.</p>
<p>B) Intake &amp; Triage (Subpoenas / LE Requests)</p>
<p>Intake form (upload + metadata): issuer, type (subpoena/warrant/court
order/civil), jurisdiction, case number, served date/time, compliance
deadline, scope (user(s), timeframe), gag order flag, contact
info.<br />
Verification checklist: signature and court details, jurisdiction match
(US), acceptable service method.<br />
Routing: autoopen Legal case with SLA timers (e.g., acknowledge within 2
business days; faster for warrants).<br />
Scope precheck: search users/bookings to confirm identifiers; if
insufficient, send clarification template (via Smart Docs §4.14.10).</p>
<p>Case view includes: timeline, documents, internal notes, holds
applied, disclosure decisions, produced packages, and recipients.</p>
<p>C) Legal Holds (Litigation / Investigations)</p>
<p>Apply hold to: user(s), booking(s)/LBG(s), studio(s), or a time range
across systems.</p>
<p>Effect: freezes deletion jobs, retention clocks, and purge
eligibility for the bound entities; banners appear in Admin entity
timelines.</p>
<p>Hold reasons: litigation, LE request, internal investigation,
tax/audit.</p>
<p>Release hold: requires twoperson approval; reasons recorded;
downstream purge job reevaluates.</p>
<p>SLA reminders: hold reviews every N days; stale holds flagged.</p>
<p>D) Retention Schedules &amp; Purge Jobs (USfirst)</p>
<p>Policy profiles (editable, with Legal approval):</p>
<p>Operational data (bookings, receipts, payouts): 7 years.</p>
<p>Chat/message content: 2 years (unless tied to dispute/hold).</p>
<p>Moderation &amp; T&amp;S case records: 5 years.</p>
<p>Logs/telemetry (nonfinancial): 30–90 days depending on
sensitivity.</p>
<p>Uploads (thumbnails/manifests): as long as portfolio item exists;
deleted 30 days after account deletion unless under hold.</p>
<p>Tax records (W9/1099 summaries): 7 years; forms stored encrypted with
restricted scope.</p>
<p>Purge engine: nightly job evaluates each record against policy &amp;
holds; performs softdelete → grace → harddelete; writes a purge ledger
entry with counts and IDs (masked).<br />
Simulation mode: preview impact before policy changes; “blastradius”
diff and rollback window.</p>
<p>E) Data Subject Requests (DSR) — Access / Deletion / OptOut</p>
<p>(USonly launch; CPRAstyle patterns to futureproof.)</p>
<p>Access/Export (Data Copy)</p>
<p>Intake: authenticated user or verified requestor; scope (account,
timeframe).</p>
<p>Output: ZIP with JSON/CSV for profile, settings, bookings/LBG,
receipts, messages (thread transcripts), reviews, references, moderation
decisions (nonconfidential summaries), verification statuses
(pass/fail), consents.</p>
<p>Redactions: thirdparty PII (emails/phones) masked unless consent or
legal basis; background/tax data summarized, not raw.</p>
<p>Hash manifest and cover letter (generated via §4.14.10).</p>
<p>SLA target: 45 days (configurable).</p>
<p>Deletion (Right to Delete)</p>
<p>Eligibility rules: block if active booking/dispute/chargeback/hold or
retention obligations (finance/tax).</p>
<p>Partial deletion: remove public content (portfolio/feed), mask
profile, stop discoverability; preserve billing/contract records under
retention and any items under legal hold.</p>
<p>Tombstone logic: display “Deleted User” on historic
threads/receipts.</p>
<p>Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) with cancellation option; after
window, irreversible purge runs (except retained records).</p>
<p>SLA: 45 days to complete when eligible.</p>
<p>OptOut (Sale/Sharing of data / Marketing)</p>
<p>Track consent and optouts; update messaging lists; record timestamp,
IP/device.</p>
<p>Do Not Sell/Share toggle (futureproof); tie to analytics adsharing
flags if applied later.</p>
<p>Status tracker: per request: received → verifying → in progress →
completed/denied (with reason). Templates for responses in §4.14.10.</p>
<p>F) Discovery &amp; Production (Civil/Criminal)</p>
<p>Search &amp; collect: entity filters (user, booking range, city),
keyword search across chats and metadata, time bounds.<br />
Review workspace: preview items with PII masked by default; unmask
gated; tag (responsive/nonresponsive/privileged).<br />
Redaction tools: blocklist (emails/phones/payment handles), manual
area/line redaction in PDFs, autoredact minors’ identifiers.<br />
Production packages:</p>
<p>Formats: PDF (with redactions), CSV/JSON for structured data,
original media hashes and links (we provide manifests for thirdparty
storage like Drive/Dropbox rather than duplicating large files).</p>
<p>Hash manifest (per file + whole set), cover letter, case
metadata.</p>
<p>Chainofcustody: who exported, when, with which scopes; twoperson
approval for release.</p>
<p>Notification rules: where permitted, notify users whose data is
produced; suppressed if gag order recorded.</p>
<p>G) Policies &amp; ClickWrap/Consent Logs</p>
<p>ToS/Privacy versions, with acceptance timestamps, IP/device, and
surfaces (web/app).</p>
<p>Edelivery consent (tax forms) and marketing consents with granularity
(email/SMS).</p>
<p>Changes: version diffs stored; user reconsent waves scheduled via
§4.14.10.</p>
<p>Download: CSV of acceptance logs by cohort (PII masked) for
audits.</p>
<p>H) Integrations</p>
<p>Trust &amp; Safety (§4.14.3): reference cases, import preserved
evidence into holds; share redacted summaries.</p>
<p>Support &amp; Disputes (§4.14.5): DSR status surface to agents; macro
responses.</p>
<p>Finance &amp; Tax (§4.14.6/§4.14.7): retention overrides for
financial/tax records; W9/1099 forms access gated to Legal.</p>
<p>Docs CMS (§4.14.10): generate cover letters, denial reasons,
clarification requests, and disclosure receipts.</p>
<p>I) Metrics &amp; SLAs</p>
<p>KPIs</p>
<p>DSR intake volume; % completed on time; average completion days.</p>
<p>Holds applied/active/reviewed; average hold age.</p>
<p>Productions count; average time from verified request → production;
redaction error rate (&lt;1%).</p>
<p>Purge job throughput and exceptions; records deleted vs retained (by
policy).</p>
<p>Consent coverage: ToS/Privacy acceptance %, Edelivery consent %.</p>
<p>Alerts</p>
<p>DSR backlog &gt; threshold or any nearing SLA breach (T7/T3/T1
days).</p>
<p>Holds older than review cadence.</p>
<p>Purge errors &gt; threshold; production export failures.</p>
<p>J) Telemetry (Legal &amp; Records)</p>
<p>legal.request.intake (type, jurisdiction) • legal.request.verify</p>
<p>legal.hold.apply/release/review</p>
<p>legal.dsr.open/verify/start/complete/deny (code)</p>

<p>legal.disclosure.approve/release (twoperson)</p>
<p>legal.consent.accept/revoke (tos|privacy|edelivery|marketing)</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark 4.14.15 FINAL)</p>
<p>Intake &amp; verification flow for subpoenas/LE requests with case
vault, SLA timers, and clarification templates.</p>
<p>Legal holds that freeze deletion and display banners; twoperson
approval to release; periodic review reminders.</p>
<p>Retention schedules configurable; purge engine with simulation,
nightly runs, and purge ledger.</p>
<p>DSR: access/export ZIP with redactions &amp; hashes; deletion flow
with tombstones, coolingoff, and eligibility rules; optout toggles
logged.</p>
<p>Discovery workspace: search, masked preview, tagging, redaction,
production with hashed manifest and chainofcustody; twoperson release
approval.</p>
<p>Clickwrap &amp; consent logs queryable and exportable.</p>
<p>Integrations with T&amp;S, Support, Finance/Tax, and Smart Docs;
notifications per policy/gag orders.</p>
<p>Metrics &amp; alerts dashboards; Telemetry events emitted for all
actions; RBAC &amp; PII scopes enforced.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Defensible: verified intake, documented holds, hashed productions,
and auditable purges.</p>
<p>Practical: redaction and manifests avoid duplicating huge media while
still producing what’s required.</p>
<p>Safe by default: masking, leastprivilege, and twoperson approvals
keep sensitive actions controlled.</p>
<p>Lowcode ops: Legal drives routine compliance without engineering;
only edge cases need dev help.</p>
<p>§4.14.16 — Sandbox &amp; Training</p>
<p>Goal: Give every ops team a safe, realistic playground to learn,
rehearse, and validate workflows—without touching production or real
PII. Provide seeded demo data, simulators for external partners, guided
role training, incident drills, and QA/UAT tooling—with hard isolation,
audits, and oneclick resets.</p>
<p>A) Scope, Roles &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Who uses this: Support, Trust &amp; Safety, City Ops, Finance/Tax,
Studios Ops, Content Moderation, Marketing/Ops, Product, Legal
(training), Readonly Auditors.</p>
<p>What it covers: Environment isolation, anonymized/procedural data,
seeders &amp; scenario packs, fake gateways
(payments/tax/ID/background), webhook simulators, guided curricula,
incident drills &amp; chaos tests, QA/UAT flows, resets &amp; snapshots,
reporting.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>No real PII ever enters Sandbox. Exports disabled; screenshots
watermarked “SANDBOX.”</p>
<p>Separate SSO &amp; RBAC realms (distinct login &amp; MFA).</p>
<p>Feature flags &amp; configs edited in Sandbox have no effect on Prod
(crossenv writes are blocked).</p>
<p>Network egress from Sandbox limited to simulators and allowlisted
endpoints.</p>
<p>B) Environments &amp; Isolation</p>
<p>DEV (for builders), SANDBOX (ops training &amp; UAT), STAGE (preprod
perf tests), PROD.</p>
<p>Prominent environment banner + URL subdomain color coding.</p>
<p>Data segregation: unique databases, storage buckets, and API keys per
environment; killswitches default ON in Sandbox for moneymoving
actions.</p>
<p>Email/SMS sink: all outbound comms land in a searchable “Message
Inbox” viewer (no real delivery).</p>
<p>C) Data Strategy (synthetic + anonymized refresh)</p>
<p>Synthetic baseline: cityaccurate Houston cohort plus two satellite
cities; 90day booking history; realistic distributions for roles, Rep
Scores, prices, availability, and social metrics.</p>
<p>Anonymized refresh (optional): scheduled job builds fully anonymized
aggregates from Prod (counts, medians, distributions)—never raw PII.
Deterministic tokenization (formatpreserving) creates realistic but
nonreversible names/handles.</p>
<p>Media: stock &amp; inhouse SFW sets with license to use for training;
thumbnails pregenerated.</p>
<p>Timemachine clock: freeze or advance Sandbox time (±30 days) to
simulate quarterend, 1099 runs, and filing windows.</p>
<p>D) Seeders &amp; Scenario Packs (oneclick load)</p>
<p>Seeders (idempotent): Users, service profiles, portfolios, studios
(verified/unverified), RFPs, bookings/LBGs, messages, deliverables
manifests, reviews, disputes, deposits, chargebacks, promos.</p>
<p>Scenario packs (choose role, city, difficulty):</p>
<p>Support: “Late delivery &amp; partial refund” — deliverables
shortfall, acceptance window, amended receipt flow.</p>
<p>T&amp;S: “Boundary violation report” — autosuppress IB, strike
ladder, neutral review handoff.</p>
<p>Finance: “Processor outage wave” — bulk partial refunds, recon
variances, payouts delay comms.</p>
<p>Tax: “State X nexus on” — enable state, category map tweak, calc
exceptions, filing calendar dryrun.</p>
<p>Moderation: “NSFW spike” — classifier thresholds, blur/crop UI,
appeals triage.</p>
<p>Studios: “Lockout at arrival” — code logs, relocation list, deposit
void.</p>
<p>Promotions: “ROAS slumps” — floors tuning, QS weights A/B, makegood
credits.</p>
<p>City Ops: “Coverage gap” — invites cohort, Founding perks, carousel
pin, Collab Day.</p>
<p>Legal: “Subpoena intake” — hold creation, discovery workspace,
redacted production pack.</p>
<p>E) Simulators &amp; Fakes (external dependencies)</p>
<p>Payments Processor Sim: card success/decline matrices, 3DS challenge
emulator, ACH microdeposit flow, payout states (queued/sent/fail),
chargebacks lifecycle with webhook playback.</p>
<p>Tax Engine Sim: city/state rate tables with toggles for
timeouts/errors; “zerowhereexpected” edge cases; efile stubs for 1099
runs.</p>
<p>ID/Background Sim: pass/fail with reason codes; throttling/bulk
delays; FCRA “adverse action” stub.</p>
<p>Content Scan Sim: NSFW classifier bands, OCR PII hits, virus
flags.</p>
<p>Notifications Sim: email/SMS/web push sink with opens/clicks.</p>
<p>Maps/Geo Sim: distance &amp; travel fee calculator; studio geocode
anomalies.</p>
<p>Social Metrics Sim: IG/TT/YT/X connectors return tokenized counts,
growth, and ratelimit errors.</p>
<p>Each simulator exposes: dashboard, force state switch, and replay
last N webhooks.</p>
<p>F) Training Modes &amp; Curricula</p>
<p>Role tracks: Support, T&amp;S, Finance/Tax, City Ops, Studios Ops,
Moderation, Promotions/Ops, Legal.</p>
<p>Guided checklists inside the Admin UI: stepbystep tasks with
autovalidation (“Issue partial refund → amended receipt generated →
totals match calculator”).</p>
<p>Inline coach marks &amp; hint videos (60–120s) per task.</p>
<p>Autograding: pass/fail with explanations; require retry when policy
violated.</p>
<p>Certifications: “Sandbox Certified — Support L1/L2”, “T&amp;S L1”,
etc.; expire annually; printable PDF badges.</p>
<p>Practice datasets rotate monthly to prevent memorization.</p>
<p>G) Incident Drills &amp; Chaos Kits</p>
<p>Drill runner: schedule P0/P1 simulations (card processor outage, tax
engine down, promotions overspend).</p>
<p>Chaos toggles: inject latency, error spikes, partial dependency
failures (e.g., 20% payout API errors).</p>
<p>Scoring: MTTD/MTTR, correct use of degradations &amp; runbooks, comms
timing, and adherence to guardrails (twoperson approvals).</p>
<p>Afteraction: autocompiled report; add action items to Observability
postmortem tracker (§4.14.13).</p>
<p>H) QA &amp; UAT Workflows (nocode)</p>
<p>Flag preview: flip §4.14.2 feature flags safely; simulate staged
rollouts and guardrail aborts.</p>
<p>Docs CMS UAT: assemble SOW/House Rules/releases; esign with fake
signers; pinned versions on fake bookings; PDF render checks.</p>
<p>Promotions UAT: CPC floors and QS weights simulations on a mirror of
last 7 days’ synthetic queries.</p>
<p>Bulk Tools UAT: dryrun mass refunds, merges, and reindexes; verify
impact tiles and rollback templates.</p>
<p>Tax UAT: 1099 dryruns with edelivery consent flows; Efile stub
returns filing IDs.</p>
<p>Search &amp; Ranking UAT: compare ranking diffs after rep
formula/weight changes on seeded data.</p>
<p>I) Resets, Snapshots &amp; Access Windows</p>
<p>Snapshot &amp; restore: nightly baseline + manual snapshots preUAT;
restore in &lt;15 min.</p>
<p>Oneclick “clean room”: wipe personal training footprints
(cases/messages) but keep seeds.</p>
<p>Access windows: training cohorts get timeboxed access; automatic
disable after window.</p>
<p>J) Guardrails &amp; Safety</p>
<p>Watermarks on every page; copy/paste of IDs adds “SANDBOX” suffix to
prevent misuse.</p>
<p>Downloads limited; CSVs watermarked; large exports blocked.</p>
<p>Money actions are virtual; Sandbox ledger kept separate; no external
funds ever move.</p>
<p>PII masks enforced; unmask buttons removed in Sandbox.</p>
<p>K) Reporting &amp; KPIs</p>
<p>Training completion rate by role/cohort; firstattempt pass %;
timetocertification.</p>
<p>Drill coverage: # of drills/quarter; average MTTD/MTTR (Sandbox);
runbook adherence.</p>
<p>UAT throughput: # of UAT sessions, issues found before Prod, rollback
rate reduction postUAT.</p>
<p>Simulator usage: webhooks replayed, failure modes exercised.</p>

<p>Guardrails (no PII, no exports, no real money movement); watermarking
everywhere.</p>
<p>Reporting &amp; telemetry for training, drills, simulators, and
UAT.</p>
<p>N) Why this works</p>
<p>Teams learn fast and safely on lifelike data.</p>
<p>Integrations behave realistically via simulators and webhooks—no
flakiness, no vendor risk.</p>
<p>Quality rises—UAT &amp; drills catch misconfigs and process gaps
before they hit production.</p>
<p>Culture of readiness—regular drills, certifications, and audits keep
everyone sharp.</p>
<p>§5.0 — Program Overview &amp; Principles</p>
<p>Goal: Establish a clear, privacysafe, auditable data foundation that
powers ops dashboards, finance/tax accuracy, trust &amp; safety, growth
analytics, and ML—while making schema evolution lowrisk and
predictable.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Owners</p>
<p>Inscope: Event contracts, IDs &amp; entity graph, ingestion
pipelines, warehouse layers (Bronze/Silver/Gold), metrics catalog &amp;
semantic layer, privacy/PII/retention, dataquality, replays/backfills,
lineage, ML feature store, and cost/perf governance.</p>
<p>Primary owners:</p>
<p>Data Eng (pipelines, storage, contracts),</p>
<p>Analytics (metrics catalog, BI/semantic layer),</p>
<p>Privacy/Compliance (PII/retention/access),</p>
<p>Finance Ops (recon &amp; monthend accuracy),</p>
<p>Product/Obs (event coverage, telemetry).</p>
<p>B) Design Tenets</p>
<p>Contracts first: Every feature emits versioned events; changes are
additive; breaking changes require new names.</p>
<p>LBGaware by design: The Linked Booking Group is a firstclass key;
legs (Talent, Studio) roll up cleanly.</p>
<p>Bronze → Silver → Gold: Raw immutable logs → clean typed models →
businessready facts/dims.</p>
<p>Privacy by default: PII masked at rest; sensitive tables in
restricted schemas with RBAC scopes (per §4.14.1/§4.14.15).</p>
<p>Dual freshness: Sub15minute ops freshness; dayaccurate finance close
each morning.</p>
<p>Single source of truth: All dashboards pull from a Metrics Catalog
with versioned definitions.</p>
<p>Replays are normal: Idempotent loads and event replays make
audits/backfills safe.</p>
<p>Costaware: Partition by date/city/role, columnar storage, lifecycle
policies, and materialized views for heavy tiles.</p>
<p>C) What Section 5 Will Deliver (roadmap)</p>
<p>§5.1 Event contract &amp; naming (envelope, namespaces, required
fields, versions).</p>
<p>§5.2 Canonical IDs &amp; entity graph (LBG/leg joins, referential
rules).</p>
<p>§5.3 Ingest &amp; pipelines (stream for ops, batch for finance).</p>
<p>§5.4 Warehouse layers &amp; privacy zones.</p>
<p>§5.5 Gold schemas (facts &amp; dims for search, bookings, finance,
promos, tax, T&amp;S, studios).</p>
<p>§5.6 Metrics catalog &amp; semantic layer (ties to §4.14.12).</p>
<p>§5.7 Privacy, PII &amp; retention policies (USfirst).</p>
<p>§5.8 Data quality &amp; testing (schema, invariants,
reconciliation).</p>
<p>§5.9 Backfills &amp; replays (tooling + runbooks).</p>
<p>§5.10 External systems &amp; lineage (origin → transforms →
dashboards).</p>
<p>§5.11 ML feature store &amp; modeling hooks (ranking, risk, Smart
Invites).</p>
<p>§5.12 Cost, performance &amp; governance (SLAs, quotas,
deprecation).</p>
<p>D) Success Metrics &amp; SLAs</p>
<p>Freshness: Ops Silver tables ≤ 15 min; Finance Gold closed by 06:00
local daily.</p>
<p>Reliability: Event loss = 0 (idempotent loads); pipeline success ≥
99.9% daily.</p>
<p>Data quality: Finance recon variance &lt; 0.5%; schema DQ failures
&lt; 0.1% runs.</p>
<p>Governance: 100% dashboard tiles reference a catalog key@version;
PIIrestricted access logged 100%.</p>
<p>Performance: BI p95 query &lt; 5s for core tiles; warehouse cost
within monthly budget (tracked).</p>
<p>E) Change Management &amp; Governance</p>
<p>PR checklist: includes event diffs &amp; metric impact note.</p>
<p>Schema registry: semver + backwardcompatible evolution checks in
CI.</p>
<p>Metric versioning: deprecation windows, with “what changed”
diffs.</p>
<p>Access control: RBAC scopes
(PIIBasic/PIISensitive/PIITax/Background); masked downloads; watermarked
exports.</p>
<p>Retention: nightly purge engine honors legal holds (from
§4.14.15).</p>
<p>F) Risks &amp; Mitigations</p>
<p>Metric drift → enforce catalog &amp; semantic layer; block adhoc SQL
in critical dashboards.</p>
<p>PII exposure → separate schemas + masking + access ledger.</p>
<p>Cost spikes → partitioning, TTL on Bronze, and scheduled
materializations.</p>
<p>Vendor outages → replayable ingest, DLQs, deterministic rebuilds.</p>
<p>G) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.0 FINAL)</p>
<p>Principles and scope approved by Data Eng, Analytics, Privacy.</p>
<p>Subsections enumerated with owners assigned.</p>
<p>CI checks for event/schema changes in place (“contracts first”).</p>
<p>SLAs &amp; success metrics recorded in Ops runbook and §4.14.12
dashboards.</p>
<p>H) Why this works</p>
<p>This aligns product, ops, finance, and compliance on one consistent
data language. It preserves velocity (additive contracts, replays) while
keeping privacy and cost under control.</p>
<p>§5.1 — Event Contract &amp; Naming</p>
<p>Goal: Define a stable, privacysafe event contract so every feature
(Sections 1–4) emits versioned, auditable events that downstream systems
can trust. Contracts are additive, LBGaware, and enforce consistent
types for time, money, IDs, and PII.</p>
<p>A) Event Envelope (required on every event)</p>
<p>All producers (web, mobile, services, admin) must include this
envelope. Fields are snake_case, UTC timestamps in ISO8601.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>"event_id": "c3e82a8b-2a1f-4e6a-9bf7-7c9b2b7e0d1a",</p>

<p>"event_version": "1.0.0",</p>
<p>"occurred_at": "2025-11-04T19:22:11Z",</p>
<p>"received_at": "2025-11-04T19:22:12Z",</p>

<p>"booking_leg_id": "leg_01HE9Z8R3C", // nullable</p>
<p>"leg_role": "talent", // enum: talent|studio|null</p>
<p>"city_id": "city_houston",</p>
<p>"state": "TX",</p>
<p>"country": "US",</p>
<p>"platform": "web", // enum: web|ios|android|admin|system</p>

<p>"privacy_tier": "pii_basic", // enum below</p>
<p>"payload": { /* event-specific schema */ }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Notes &amp; constraints</p>
<p>Monetary values in minor units (cents) as integers and ISO currency
in payload (e.g., "currency": "USD").</p>
<p>IDs are stable, opaque strings (see §5.2).</p>
<p>PII (email, phone, TIN, full address) must not appear in payloads;
store tokens/IDs and join in protected tables only.</p>
<p>occurred_at is when the action happened; received_at is ingestion
time; both required.</p>
<p>B) Naming Rules</p>
<p>event_name is namespace.action in snake_case, e.g., search.query_run,
fin.checkout_pay_success.</p>
<p>Namespaces (toplevel):<br />
acct, search, profile, msg, booking, deliver, promo, fin, tax, studio,
sup, ts, cms, data, obs, bulk, legal.</p>
<p>Action verbs: run, click, open, send, read, request, accept, decline,
cancel, change_order, upload, accept, queue, sent, fail, charge, credit,
calc_request, calc_response, case_open, decision, publish, rollback,
start, finish.</p>
<p>No breaking renames. If semantics change incompatibly, mint a new
event_name.</p>
<p>C) Versioning Policy (semver)</p>
<p>event_version = "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH".</p>
<p>MINOR/PATCH: add optional fields, tighten enums with
backwardcompatible defaults.</p>
<p>MAJOR: breaking change → do not bump; create a new event_name (e.g.,
booking.request → booking.request_v2).</p>
<p>Producers must not drop required fields of an existing version.</p>
<p>D) Types, Enums &amp; Limits (global)</p>
<p>Time: ISO8601 UTC.</p>
<p>Money: integers in cents; currency code "USD" at launch.</p>
<p>Distance/geo: meters (int) or "lat","lon" floats when needed.</p>
<p>Strings: max 1,024 chars unless noted; free text capped to 5,000.</p>
<p>Arrays: max 1,000 elements; item types defined per schema.</p>
<p>Enums (global):</p>
<p>actor_role:
buyer|model|photographer|videographer|creator|studio_host|admin|system</p>
<p>leg_role: talent|studio</p>
<p>platform: web|ios|android|admin|system</p>
<p>privacy_tier:
public|pii_basic|pii_sensitive|pii_tax|pii_background</p>
<p>E) Privacy Tiers (enforced at ingest)</p>
<p>public: no PII, safe for broad analytics.</p>
<p>pii_basic: indirect identifiers (user IDs, ip_hash, masked
last4).</p>
<p>pii_sensitive: address fragments, DOB (never emitted in events—only
tokens permitted; use for joins if absolutely necessary).</p>
<p>pii_tax: W9/W8/1099 refs (IDs only).</p>
<p>pii_background: background check references (IDs only).</p>
<p>Rule: Raw PII values are forbidden in event payloads; only tokens/IDs
allowed.</p>
<p>F) Core Event Families &amp; Schemas (v1)</p>

<p>G) Producer Obligations</p>
<p>Emit at least the events listed above for the flows you
implement.</p>
<p>Include the envelope fields, correct privacy_tier, and validated
payload per schema.</p>
<p>Idempotency: do not reemit the same event_id; retries must reuse the
event_id.</p>
<p>Ordering: preserve perentity ordering (e.g., for a given
booking_leg_id) when feasible.</p>
<p>H) Schema Registry &amp; CI</p>
<p>JSON Schemas (per event_name &amp; event_version) live in the Schema
Registry; publishers fetch at build.</p>
<p>CI checks:</p>
<p>Validate all emitted test payloads against registry.</p>
<p>Block PRs that remove required fields or introduce forbidden PII.</p>
<p>Require a diff note describing metric impact for any event change
(ties to §5.6 catalog).</p>
<p>I) Backward Compatibility &amp; Deprecation</p>
<p>Add fields as optional first; only make required after a tworelease
grace period and consumer readiness.</p>
<p>For breaking semantics, mint a new event_name (e.g., _v2) and run
both for one release cycle, then deprecate older.</p>
<p>The Registry marks deprecated with an EOL date; ingestion continues
but dashboards switch based on the catalog version.</p>
<p>J) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.1 FINAL)</p>
<p>Envelope and required fields implemented by all producers (web,
mobile, services, admin).</p>
<p>Naming &amp; semver rules enforced; namespaces aligned with product
modules.</p>
<p>Privacy tiers validated; ingestion blocks forbidden PII.</p>
<p>JSON Schemas for the 12 core families published to the Registry with
examples.</p>
<p>CI gating for schema validation &amp; “no breaking changes without
new name.”</p>
<p>Sample payloads validated endtoend into Bronze; test tables show
expected rows.</p>
<p>K) Why this works</p>
<p>Stable for consumers (dashboards, finance, ML) because producers
evolve additively.</p>
<p>Auditable because every event has consistent IDs, timestamps, and
privacy classification.</p>
<p>Search/LBG aware so key marketplace concepts roll up cleanly.</p>
<p>Lowrisk evolution via schema registry + CI and clear deprecation
paths.</p>
<p>§5.2 — Canonical IDs &amp; Entity Graph</p>
<p>Goal: Define stable, opaque IDs and a precise entity graph so
bookings, payments, messaging, docs, studios, promotions, tax, and
safety all join cleanly. Prevent double counting, enable LBG (Linked
Booking Group) rollups, and support merges, soft deletions, and audits
without code rewrites.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Design Goals</p>
<p>One source of truth for IDs, relationships, and cardinalities across
Sections 1–4.</p>
<p>Opaque, nonguessable IDs (no PII embedded).</p>
<p>LBGaware joins: legs (Talent, Studio) roll up to an LBG where
applicable.</p>
<p>No hard deletes on principals (users, bookings, studios): use soft
delete / tombstones and legal holds (see §4.14.15).</p>
<p>Compatible with §5.1 events and §4.14.x admin ops (bulk tools,
disputes, finance, tax, studios).</p>
<p>B) ID Strategy (format, creation, safety)</p>
<p>Format: 26char ULID/UUIDv7style opaque strings, URLsafe, lowercase,
prefixed for readability.<br />
Generation: Serverside only; idempotent creators accept client retries
without duplicating (caller supplies a natural key or request id).<br />
Environment: IDs are environmentscoped (never move between
Sandbox/Prod).<br />
PII: IDs never encode emails, names, or locations.</p>
<p>Example: usr_01HE9Z7A5S6E3Z1B8QK3J8N3QX (prefix + ULID body)</p>
<p>C) Canonical ID Catalog (v1)</p>
<p>Rule: Reviews, pricing, availability, and search exposure are tied to
service_profile_id, not user_id—this keeps multirole users clean.</p>
<p>D) Entity Graph &amp; Cardinalities (core)</p>
<p>Users &amp; Profiles</p>
<p>user_id 1—M service_profile_id (one per role; can be multiple of the
same role if needed later—v1 uses one)</p>
<p>user_id 1—M studio_id (host can own several studios)</p>
<p>Bookings</p>
<p>lbg_id 1—M booking_leg_id (0 or many legs; singleleg bookings have an
LBG too for uniformity)</p>
<p>Each booking_leg_id belongs to exactly one service_profile_id
(provider) and one buyer user_id</p>
<p>booking_leg_id 1—M doc_id (SOW, Releases, Change Orders)</p>
<p>Messaging</p>
<p>message_thread_id belongs to a booking_leg_id or lbg_id (group
thread); messages reference the thread</p>
<p>Reviews &amp; References</p>
<p>review_id belongs to booking_leg_id (source of truth) and attaches to
service_profile_id</p>
<p>reference_id belongs to a user_id pair; optional artifact asset_id or
external link</p>
<p>Payments</p>
<p>charge_id belongs to lbg_id (group checkout) and references each
booking_leg_id in line items</p>
<p>refund_id belongs to charge_id; may reference specific leg lines</p>
<p>payout_id belongs to user_id (seller) and aggregates multiple
booking_leg_id settlements</p>
<p>deposit_id belongs to a studio leg (booking_leg_id with
leg_role=studio)</p>
<p>Promotions</p>
<p>promotion_campaign_id belongs to a service_profile_id; click charges
link to the campaign and the viewer (hashed)</p>
<p>Safety/Support</p>
<p>ts_case_id and support_case_id reference whichever scope applies:
user_id, service_profile_id, booking_leg_id, or lbg_id</p>
<p>Tax/Compliance</p>
<p>w9_id belongs to user_id (payee), not profile; form1099_id belongs to
user_id per tax year</p>
<p>tax_calc_id belongs to lbg_id at checkout time</p>
<p>E) Key Lifecycles (state machines)</p>
<p>Service Profile: draft → published → paused → banned (T&amp;S) →
deleted (soft)<br />
Booking Leg: requested → accepted → in_progress → delivered → completed
→ (optional) disputed → resolved<br />
LBG: created → paid → all legs completed → closed<br />
Studio: onboarding → verified → reverify_due → suspended<br />
Promotion Campaign: active → paused → completed → archived<br />
Payout: queued → sent → failed (retryable) → settled<br />
Deposit: authorized → captured/voided → released (or retained by
claim)</p>
<p>State changes emit §5.1 events (e.g., booking.accept,
fin.payout.sent, studio.verify.approve).</p>
<p>F) Referential Integrity &amp; Cascades</p>
<p>No hard deletes for: users, profiles, studios, legs, LBGs, charges,
payouts, docs. Use deleted_at (soft) or legal hold flags.</p>
<p>Cascade rules (logical, via jobs):</p>
<p>User merge (see §4.14.14): reparent all child records to the
canonical user_id; service_profile_ids either merge (same role) or
remain distinct (multibrand).</p>
<p>Profile delete (soft): remove from search; keep bookings/reviews
intact (historical).</p>
<p>Studio delete (soft): pause new bookings; preserve history; deposits
must be closed.</p>
<p>Foreign keys enforced in Silver/Gold models; Bronze is
eventappendonly.</p>
<p>G) MultiRole Modeling (why profiles matter)</p>
<p>Search &amp; pricing live on service_profile_id, keeping criteria
clean per role (model vs photographer vs videographer vs creator).</p>
<p>Reviews and Rep Score compute per profile, then roll up to userlevel
(display both on profile).</p>
<p>Messaging is per booking; inbox groups threads by role (“Model
Inbox”, “Photographer Inbox”) for clarity.</p>
<p>H) LBG Semantics (grouping multiple legs)</p>
<p>An LBG ties multiple legs (e.g., Talent + Studio) so the buyer can
check out once and receive a Group Receipt (see §4.12).</p>
<p>Cancel/Dispute is legscoped; the other leg remains intact. Group
status reflects all legs.</p>
<p>Payments: one charge_id at checkout linked to lbg_id, lineitems to
each booking_leg_id.</p>
<p>Receipts &amp; Docs: each leg has its own SOW/Release; group receipt
links both.</p>
<p>I) Indexing &amp; Partition Hints (warehouse view)</p>
<p>Facts partitioned by dt and clustered by city_id, role, lbg_id or
booking_leg_id (per table).</p>
<p>Dim tables (SCD2) use valid_from/valid_to and natural keys
(service_profile_id, city_id).</p>
<p>Unique constraints:</p>
<p>review_id unique per booking_leg_id per reviewer.</p>
<p>promotion_campaign_id unique per service_profile_id per time
window.</p>
<p>One active w9_id per payee user_id.</p>
<p>Join paths used by BI are fixed in §5.5 (star schema).</p>
<p>J) Examples (how things join)</p>
<p>Example 1 — Provider earnings for a week</p>
<p>fact_payout (Gold) → filter sent_at between dates &amp; user_id =
provider.</p>
<p>Drill into payout breakdown table → join booking_leg_id lines → join
dim_service_profile to show role and city.</p>
<p>Sum net cents; show legs &amp; group them by lbg_id if needed.</p>
<p>Example 2 — Reviews &amp; Rep for a photographer</p>
<p>Get service_profile_id where role=photographer for user_id.</p>
<p>Join fact_booking_leg (completed legs) → review_id and ratings.</p>
<p>Compute profile Rep Score (timeweighted); separately compute user Rep
from all profiles.</p>
<p>Example 3 — Group receipt</p>
<p>lbg_id → list legs in fact_booking_leg.</p>
<p>For each leg: join doc_id for SOW/Release, join fact_payment line
items; union to build group totals.</p>
<p>K) Validation Rules (loadtime checks)</p>
<p>A booking_leg_id must have: buyer user_id, provider
service_profile_id, city_id, start_at &lt; end_at, and one state at a
time.</p>
<p>A charge_id linked to an lbg_id must reconcile to the sum of included
leg lines ± buyer fee/tax.</p>
<p>A review_id must reference a completed leg and match the buyer on
that leg.</p>
<p>A deposit_id must reference a studio leg.</p>
<p>A form1099_id must map to an eligible payee and the sum of payouts
for that tax year.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.2 FINAL)</p>
<p>ID catalog (names, prefixes, examples) published and used
consistently by all services &amp; events.</p>
<p>Entity graph documented with cardinalities; enforced via Silver/Gold
FK tests.</p>
<p>LBG semantics implemented: legs roll up, payments group at checkout,
receipts/doc links per leg + group.</p>
<p>Multirole separation: search/reviews/rep attached to
service_profile_id; rollup to user shown in UI.</p>
<p>Lifecycle states defined for key entities; state transitions emit
§5.1 events.</p>
<p>Softdelete and legal hold patterns applied; no cascaded hard
deletes.</p>
<p>Validation rules in pipeline block malformed joins; data quality
tests green.</p>
<p>Warehouse hints (partitioning/clustering) documented and followed in
§5.5 schemas.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Keeps multirole users sane (clean, rolespecific search and reviews)
while preserving a single account.</p>
<p>Group bookings (LBG) capture realworld flows (talent + studio)
without muddying payments or disputes.</p>
<p>Opaque, wellscoped IDs plus soft deletion and legal holds make audits
and merges safe.</p>
<p>Analysts, Finance, T&amp;S, and Ops all get consistent joins—no
double counts, no missing links.</p>
<p>§5.3 — Ingest &amp; Pipelines (Stream/Batch)</p>
<p>Goal: Move events from clients/services to analyticsready tables with
&lt;15minute freshness for ops and dayaccurate finance—safely, cheaply,
and replayably. Enforce contracts from §5.1, IDs from §5.2, privacy
gates, and exactlyonce semantics at sinks.</p>
<p>A) Architecture at a Glance</p>
<p>Producers (web/mobile/services/admin) → Edge Collector (HTTP/gRPC) →
Event Bus (ordered, durable) →<br />
Bronze landing (appendonly, validated, partitioned) → Silver streaming
transforms (typed, PIImasked, enriched + CDC) →<br />
Gold batch close (daily finance/tax facts; reconciled) →
BI/ML/alerts.</p>
<p>Control planes: Schema Registry (contracts), Feature Flags (rates,
sampling), DLQ/Quarantine UI, Replay tool, Data Quality monitors.</p>
<p>B) Edge Collection (client/sdk rules)</p>
<p>Envelope required (per §5.1). SDKs batch events, gzip, and send over
TLS; retriable with exponential backoff.</p>
<p>Size limits: payload ≤ 64 KB; batch ≤ 512 KB; queue cap per device to
avoid memory blowups.</p>
<p>Clock skew: include device time; collector normalizes to UTC and adds
received_at.</p>
<p>PII filter at edge: reject events that contain forbidden fields
(email, phone, TIN, full address, PAN), return 4xx to SDK with reason;
do not store.</p>
<p>Sampling: off by default; can enable for highvolume impression events
later (never for money/safety).</p>
<p>Auth: producer token (rotated); admin events require mTLS and role
claim.</p>
<p>Idempotency: SDK must reuse the same event_id on retry; collector
dedups per event_id for a short window.</p>
<p>C) Event Bus (topics, keys, ordering)</p>
<p>Topics by domain (mirror namespaces): search, msg, booking, deliver,
fin, promo, tax, studio, sup, ts, cms, obs, bulk, legal.</p>
<p>Partition key defaults:</p>
<p>booking, deliver, fin: booking_leg_id (preserves perleg order).</p>
<p>lbgscoped payments/tax: lbg_id.</p>
<p>msg: message_thread_id.</p>
<p>profile/search/promo: service_profile_id.</p>
<p>Fallback to actor_user_id if others null.</p>
<p>Ordering guarantees: within a key/partition. Processors must handle
late arrivals; don’t assume global order.</p>
<p>D) Bronze Landing (appendonly, validated)</p>
<p>Store immutable events as columnar files (e.g., Parquet) partitioned
by dt = occurred_at::date and event_name.</p>
<p>Schema validation: every record validated against Schema Registry;
add validation_status (ok|warn|fail).</p>
<p>Dedup: unique on event_id; keep the first arrival (subsequent
duplicates to bronze.dedup_skipped).</p>
<p>Privacy tagging: persist privacy_tier; events with forbidden PII
never land (blocked at edge).</p>
<p>DLQs / Quarantine families:</p>
<p>schema_violation (unknown name/version, wrong types),</p>
<p>oversize (exceeds limits),</p>
<p>unknown_actor (missing/invalid ID),</p>
<p>contract_break (required field missing),</p>
<p>poison_pill (processor crash repro sample).</p>
<p>Lineage stamps: ingest_id, collector_id, bus_offset.</p>
<p>E) Silver Transforms (streaming; &lt;15min SLA)</p>
<p>Engines: streaming jobs (tooling TBD in tech plan) consume bus →
write typed, partitioned Silver tables.</p>
<p>Common transforms</p>
<p>Flatten payload into typed columns; enforce enums; discard extra
fields into payload_extra (for forwardcompat).</p>
<p>Enrich with dimensions: dim_city, dim_service_profile, dim_user (CDC
feeds below).</p>
<p>PII masking: keep only hashed tokens; no raw PII fields.</p>
<p>Watermarks &amp; lateness: allow 10–30 min eventtime lateness;
recompute small windows to capture stragglers.</p>
<p>Exactlyonce sinks: use merge/upsert on natural keys (e.g., event_id,
or (charge_id,leg_id,line_no) for facts).</p>
<p>Stateful joins (where needed): e.g., correlate fin.checkout_pay_*
with booking.request for sanity checks.</p>
<p>Silver tables (illustrative)</p>
<p>silver.events_search (query, filters, results_count, promoted
flag)</p>
<p>silver.events_msg (thread/message actions)</p>
<p>silver.booking_events (request/accept/decline/cancel/change_order
with deltas)</p>
<p>silver.deliver_events (uploads, accepts, revision requests)</p>
<p>silver.fin_events (charges, refunds, payouts, deposits)</p>
<p>silver.promo_events (clicks valid/invalid, featured starts)</p>
<p>silver.tax_events (calc req/resp, 1099 delivery)</p>
<p>silver.ts_events / silver.support_events</p>
<p>silver.studio_events (verify, deposit lifecycle)</p>
<p>silver.docs_events (sow/release/change orders)</p>
<p>CDC feeds (reference dims)</p>
<p>From transactional DB to Silver: silver.dim_user_cdc,
silver.dim_service_profile_cdc, silver.dim_studio_cdc,
silver.dim_policy_cdc.</p>
<p>Built with SCD2 patterns (valid_from/to); merged nightly into Gold
dims.</p>
<p>Data Quality guards (inline)</p>
<p>Reject impossible money math (negative totals); push to quarantine;
raise S2 alert (§4.14.13).</p>
<p>Check ID referential existence within a lookback window; missing dims
flagged.</p>
<p>F) Gold Finance Close (daily batch; dayaccurate)</p>
<p>A deterministic batch (cron after local midnight) computes reconciled
finance/tax facts and other heavy facts:</p>
<p>Assemble leg lines from silver.fin_events and
silver.booking_events.</p>
<p>Compute net lines: provider fee, buyer fee, discounts, taxes,
processor fees, reserves, early payout fees.</p>
<p>Reconcile against processor settlements (settlement feed) and deposit
captures; write variances.</p>
<p>Finalize facts: fact_payment, fact_payout, fact_tax, fact_deposit,
fact_lbg, fact_booking_leg (see §5.5).</p>
<p>Lock window (idempotent): reruns overwrite same day with same
results; variances tracked.</p>
<p>Emit DQ &amp; recon reports to Finance dashboard (§4.14.12 D9).</p>
<p>SLA: Gold finance complete by 06:00 local daily; retries autoescalate
to SRE/Finance on failure.</p>
<p>G) Replays, Backfills &amp; Corrections</p>
<p>Event Replay Tool: select event_name, date range, optional IDs →
republish to bus with replayed_at and original occurred_at; Bronze dedup
uses event_id, so replays in Bronze are separate (replay=true) and flow
through Silver with merge keys to update rows.</p>
<p>Gold recompute: partitioned by dt; rerun only affected days (and
dependent windows).</p>
<p>Contract evolution: new fields flow through Silver with payload_extra
until consumers adopt; no breaking changes.</p>
<p>Audit trail: replays recorded in data.replay logs (who/why/range) and
visible in §4.14.12 Data QA.</p>
<p>H) Performance, Scaling &amp; Cost</p>
<p>Microbatch streaming intervals: 1–2 min; watermark 10–30 min; tune
per topic.</p>
<p>File sizes: Parquet 128–256 MB target; compaction jobs to coalesce
small files.</p>
<p>Partitioning: by dt; cluster by city_id, role, and
lbg_id/booking_leg_id where appropriate.</p>
<p>TTL: Bronze raw retained 90 days (configurable; see §5.12); Silver
retained per policy; Gold retained per retention (§4.14.15).</p>
<p>Hot paths: materialize BI views for heavy tiles (search CTR,
promotions ROAS).</p>
<p>I) Reliability &amp; Failure Modes (with playbooks)</p>
<p>Bus outage/backlog → backpressure; raise S1; autoscale consumers;
catchup metrics (lag minutes) on cockpit (§4.14.13).</p>
<p>Bronze write failures → circuit break to local spool; alarm; drain
when store healthy.</p>
<p>Schema drift → events to schema_violation DLQ; alert Data Eng; hotfix
in Schema Registry.</p>
<p>Downstream warehouse outage → buffer in object store; resume; mark
dashboards “partial” via freshness badges (§4.14.12).</p>
<p>Poison pill → capture sample to DLQ; sandbox reprocess; issue patch;
replay.</p>
<p>J) Security &amp; Compliance</p>
<p>Transport: TLS everywhere; admin producers require mTLS.</p>
<p>AuthZ: producer tokens bound to namespaces; ratelimits per token.</p>
<p>At rest: serverside encryption; restricted IAM per bucket/prefix.</p>
<p>Privacy: no raw PII beyond masked tokens in events; privacy_tier
enforced; sensitive tables isolated (see §5.7).</p>
<p>Access: Bronze is restricted; most users consume from Gold/Silver
views via RBAC.</p>
<p>K) Telemetry (pipeline &amp; health events)</p>
<p>Emit ops events (consumed by §4.14.12/§4.14.13 dashboards):</p>
<p>data.ingest.accept/deny (reason) • data.bus.lag_minutes •
data.bronze.write.ok/fail</p>
<p>data.silver.job.late_events (count, max_lateness) •
data.silver.upsert.errors</p>
<p>data.gold.close.start/finish/fail • data.recon.variance
(amount_cents)</p>
<p>data.dlq.enqueue/resolve (family) • data.replay.start/finish</p>
<p>Freshness gauges per table.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.3 FINAL)</p>
<p>Edge Collector enforces contracts, size limits, PII filter, auth,
idempotent retries.</p>
<p>Event Bus topics &amp; keys set; perentity ordering preserved;
backpressure metrics visible.</p>
<p>Bronze landing: validated, deduped by event_id, partitioned, with DLQ
families and lineage stamps.</p>
<p>Silver streaming: typed tables, enrich joins, PII masked, watermarks
for late data, exactlyonce upserts.</p>
<p>CDC for dims available; SCD2 merge pattern in place.</p>
<p>Gold daily close builds finance/tax facts; reconciled to settlements;
SLA 06:00 local.</p>
<p>Replay/backfill tooling works; audit logs for replays; partitioned
recompute only.</p>
<p>Performance/cost controls (compaction, partitioning, TTL) configured;
freshness &lt;15 min for ops tables.</p>
<p>Security/RBAC applied; Bronze restricted; telemetry &amp; DQ alerts
wire to Observability.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Opsfast, financetrue: streaming for freshness, batch for
reconciliation.</p>
<p>Safe evolution: schema registry + additive contracts + quarantine
protect consumers.</p>
<p>Resilient &amp; auditable: DLQs, replays, lineage stamps, and recon
reports keep trust high.</p>
<p>Costaware &amp; scalable: partitioning, compaction, TTLs, and
clustered layouts limit warehouse spend</p>
<p>§5.4 — Warehouse Layers &amp; Privacy Zones</p>
<p>Goal: Make analytics fast and trustworthy without risking PII.
Separate raw logs from curated business tables, isolate sensitive fields
in a vault, and give each team the right layer with RBAC, masking, and
retention builtin. Be LBGaware (Linked Booking Group) so legs roll up
cleanly.</p>
<p>A) Layers at a Glance (what each is for)</p>
<p>Rule: Dashboards in §4.14.12 read Gold/Gold_Restricted only. Silver
is for pipelines &amp; ML feature building; Bronze is never used for
BI.</p>
<p>B) Physical Layout &amp; Naming</p>
<p>Schemas / databases</p>
<p>bronze.* (e.g., bronze.events_booking__2025_11)</p>
<p>silver.* (e.g., silver.booking_events, silver.dim_user_cdc)</p>
<p>gold.* (e.g., gold.fact_booking_leg, gold.dim_service_profile)</p>
<p>gold_restricted.* (masked views over gold.*)</p>
<p>vault_pii.* (e.g., vault_pii.user_contact, vault_pii.tax_forms)</p>
<p>gov.* (catalog, lineage, dataquality, metric catalog, retention
ledgers)</p>
<p>Table naming rules</p>
<p>Events by domain in Silver: silver.&lt;domain&gt;_events (e.g.,
silver.fin_events)</p>
<p>Facts/Dims in Gold: gold.fact_&lt;subject&gt;,
gold.dim_&lt;entity&gt;</p>
<p>Materialized rollups: gold.mv_&lt;subject&gt;__&lt;grain&gt; (e.g.,
gold.mv_search_ctr__day_city_role)</p>
<p>All Gold facts include lbg_id and/or booking_leg_id to support LBG
rollups.</p>
<p>C) Privacy Zones &amp; RBAC (who can see what)</p>
<p>Zones</p>
<p>Public/Operational (default): no raw PII; masked tokens only.</p>
<p>Restricted: masked PII view with limited unmaskability (percolumn,
perrole).</p>
<p>Sensitive: tax/background artifacts; accessible to Legal/Tax only
with twoperson approval (per §4.14.1 &amp; §4.14.15).</p>
<p>Access groups (examples)</p>
<p>Finance → gold (all facts), gold_restricted (masked buyer emails), no
vault_pii (except recon contact via JustInTime elevation).</p>
<p>Trust &amp; Safety → gold_restricted, selective Sensitive views for
case evidence via JIT.</p>
<p>Analytics/City Ops/Marketing → gold_restricted only.</p>
<p>Legal/Tax → vault_pii + Sensitive forms; downloads watermarked;
dualapproval to unmask.</p>
<p>Rowlevel security (RLS)</p>
<p>Optional city scoping for contractors: RLS filters rows by
city_id.</p>
<p>Dynamic masking</p>
<p>Email/phone shown as j***@example.com, (***) ***1234 unless unmasked
by scope &amp; reason.</p>
<p>D) PII Strategy (tokens, vault, masking)</p>
<p>Tokenization at ingest: Emails/phones hashed/tokenized; only tokens
flow to Bronze/Silver/Gold.</p>
<p>Vault_PII holds minimal reversible mappings: user_id, token,
encrypted value (KMS), last4, verification flags, timestamps.</p>
<p>Unmask flow: Admin JIT elevation (reason + ticket) → scoped SQL
function → audited view for a limited window; export watermarking
enforced.</p>
<p>Never in events: SSNs/TINs, full card PANs, full addresses are not in
§5.1 payloads; W9/1099 PDFs live in vault_pii.tax_forms with access
gates.</p>
<p>E) Retention &amp; Lifecycle (cost + compliance)</p>
<p>Bronze: retain 90 days, then archive to cold storage; legal holds
pause deletes.</p>
<p>Silver: retain 12–24 months for ops analyses; compact monthly; purge
per retention schedule (§4.14.15).</p>
<p>Gold: retain per record class—finance/tax 7 years, T&amp;S 5 years,
support 2–3 years, generic product facts 24 months; softdelete/tombstone
handled in dims.</p>
<p>Vault_PII: retain per legal policy (tax 7 years); deletion honored
for DSR where lawful (keep financial minimums).</p>
<p>Purge ledger in gov.retention_log writes counts, IDs (masked), policy
reason, and job run.</p>
<p>F) Partitioning, Clustering &amp; Indexing</p>
<p>Partition large facts by dt (UTC date), cluster by city_id, role, and
lbg_id/booking_leg_id.</p>
<p>Dims (SCD2): cluster by entity id; use valid_from/valid_to with
current row flags.</p>
<p>Search facts: cluster by role, city_id, query_hash.</p>
<p>Promotions: cluster by service_profile_id, city_id.</p>
<p>Tax &amp; payouts: cluster by state, city_id, user_id for SLA
queries.</p>
<p>G) Gold Contract (what every fact must include)</p>
<p>Required columns in every fact_*:</p>
<p>dt (date), city_id, role (where applicable), lbg_id and/or
booking_leg_id, user_id (owner of the record, e.g., provider for
payouts), created_at, updated_at.</p>
<p>Money columns are integers in cents + currency (USD).</p>
<p>LBG vs leg flags: is_group_rollup (bool) or separate tables (see
§5.5).</p>
<p>Source stamp: bronze_offset, event_version_hash.</p>
<p>Softdelete flag for rebuilds and backfills.</p>
<p>Dim contracts (dim_*):</p>
<p>Surrogate key, natural key (e.g., service_profile_id), SCD2 columns,
current_flag, deleted_at (nullable).</p>
<p>H) Materializations &amp; Performance</p>
<p>Materialized views for hot tiles in §4.14.12 (e.g., marketplace KPIs,
ROAS, search CTR).</p>
<p>Incremental refresh cadence: hourly for ops, daily for finance.</p>
<p>Compaction jobs coalesce small files into 128–256 MB targets.</p>
<p>Query guards: perteam slots/quotas; kill long scans; hints to always
use partition filters.</p>
<p>Cost dashboards (per §5.12) track spend by schema/table and top
queries.</p>
<p>I) Catalog, Lineage &amp; Quality Annotations</p>
<p>Data Catalog (gov.catalog): table owner, freshness SLA, privacy zone,
retention policy, business description, and metric keys used (links to
§4.14.12).</p>
<p>Lineage: each Gold table lists upstream Silver/Bronze sources; BI
tiles show lineage links.</p>
<p>Quality badges: Red/Amber/Green derived from DQ monitors (see §5.8);
tiles hide or show warnings accordingly.</p>
<p>J) Developer &amp; Analyst Interfaces</p>
<p>Analysts: query gold_restricted.* through the semantic layer (metrics
catalog in §5.6); no adhoc joins to vault or Bronze.</p>
<p>Data Science: sample from Silver snapshots for model training;
feature store pulls from Gold (see §5.11).</p>
<p>Finance: read Gold finance snapshots (locked daily); recon exports
scheduled to Finance dashboard.</p>
<p>Legal/Tax: governed access to vault_pii.* with export watermarking
&amp; chainofcustody logs.</p>
<p>K) Security, Keys &amp; Audits</p>
<p>Encryption at rest with KMS; key rotation per policy.</p>
<p>Grant model: least privilege; role → schema/table permissions;
columnlevel masks where needed.</p>
<p>All downloads watermarked (user, timestamp, query hash); exports
logged in gov.export_log.</p>
<p>DLP scans nightly for forbidden patterns in nonvault schemas; alert
if found (block on repeat).</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.4 FINAL)</p>
<p>Schemas created: bronze, silver, gold, gold_restricted (masked
views), vault_pii, gov.</p>
<p>RBAC &amp; masking policies enforced per zone; RLS optional by city;
JIT unmask with audit logs live.</p>
<p>Retention policies configured per layer; purge engine writes to
gov.retention_log; legal holds pause deletes.</p>
<p>Partitioning/clustering set per table family; compaction jobs
scheduled; performance quotas active.</p>
<p>Gold facts/dims conform to contracts (money in cents, LBG/leg keys,
source stamps); SCD2 dims in place.</p>
<p>Catalog metadata populated (owner, SLA, privacy, retention); lineage
links from Gold → Silver/Bronze.</p>
<p>DLP scans &amp; export watermarking active; downloads audited; keys
rotated.</p>
<p>Cost dashboards running; freshness SLAs (&lt;15 min ops; daily
finance close) visible in §4.14.12.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Fast for teams, safe for users: Gold is readytouse and masked;
sensitive data is quarantined to the vault with tight gates.</p>
<p>Auditable: Bronze stays immutable; lineage and contracts make every
number explainable.</p>
<p>Scalable &amp; costaware: Partitioning, compaction, and
materializations keep queries snappy and bills predictable.</p>
<p>LBGaware: Facts carry group and leg keys, so talent and studio flows
tie together cleanly.</p>
<p>§5.5 — Gold Schemas (Facts &amp; Dimensions)</p>
<p>Goal: Define the businessready tables analysts, Finance, Ops, and
Product will use—clean keys, LBGaware rollups, money in cents, SCD2
dimensions, and predictable joins. All tables conform to §5.4 contracts
and IDs from §5.2.</p>
<p>A) Modeling rules (apply to every Gold table)</p>
<p>Keys: Use opaque IDs from §5.2; every fact includes dt (UTC date),
city_id, and at least one of lbg_id or booking_leg_id.</p>
<p>Money: Integers in cents + currency='USD'. Totals reconcile to §5.3
Gold finance close.</p>
<p>PII: No raw PII; joins to masked dims only (see gold_restricted).</p>
<p>Soft delete: is_deleted (bool) present where entities can be retired;
history preserved.</p>
<p>Timestamps: created_at, updated_at; facts add
occurred_at/finalized_at as needed.</p>
<p>SCD2 dims: valid_from, valid_to, current_flag.</p>

<p>G) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.5 FINAL)</p>
<p>Dims created with SCD2 (dim_user, dim_service_profile, dim_studio,
dim_city, dim_policy, dim_promotion_campaign, dim_doc_template).</p>
<p>Facts created with grains &amp; columns as above (fact_lbg,
fact_booking_leg, fact_payment + fact_payment_line, fact_payout +
fact_payout_leg, fact_deposit, fact_tax, fact_promo, fact_search,
fact_thread_activity, fact_support_case, fact_ts_case, fact_docs,
fact_social_snapshot).</p>
<p>Partitioning/clustering follow §5.4; money in cents; timestamps
consistent.</p>
<p>Allocation math implemented &amp; reconciles to §5.3 finance close;
DQ tests green.</p>
<p>Semantic layer (next §5.6) maps these tables to curated
measures/dimensions; catalog entries created for each measure.</p>
<p>H) Why this works</p>
<p>Clean grains and keys make queries fast and predictable.</p>
<p>LBG vs leg separation reflects real workflows (talent + studio)
without double counting.</p>
<p>SCD2 dims capture profile/policy changes historically for fair
analytics.</p>
<p>The set covers marketplace health, money, trust/safety, promotions,
and social in one consistent model.</p>
<p>§5.6 — Metrics Catalog &amp; Semantic Layer</p>
<p>Goal: Give every team one consistent, audited set of metrics—with
clear, versioned definitions; safe, LBGaware rollups; and a semantic
layer that prevents double counting and “SQL drift.” Dashboards, alerts,
experiments, and ML features all read from this layer.</p>
<p>A) What this delivers</p>
<p>A versioned Metrics Catalog (YAML/JSON) where each metric has: key,
owner, business definition, SQL logic path, grain, allowed dimensions,
filters, privacy tier, and test suite.</p>
<p>A semantic layer (views/API) that enforces correct joins and grains
(e.g., LBG vs leg), exposes curated measures/dimensions, and blocks
unsafe combinations.</p>
<p>Change safety: Metric semver, deprecation windows, and “definition
hash” tags on dashboards (matches §4.14.12).</p>
<p>B) Modeling rules (global)</p>
<p>Grain first: Every metric declares its base grain (e.g., leg, LBG,
campaignday). Aggregations always respect that grain.</p>
<p>LBGaware: Leglevel money (provider earnings, payouts) uses
fact_booking_leg; grouplevel money (checkout totals) uses
fact_lbg/fact_payment.</p>
<p>Money in cents: All $ in cents; semantic layer exposes both *_cents
and formatted USD.</p>
<p>Ratios: Always recompute as Σ numerator / Σ denominator at query time
(never average of ratios).</p>
<p>Attribution transparency: Promotions metrics report both “direct” and
“incremental (holdoutestimated)” values.</p>
<p>Defaults: Time grain = day, currency = USD, Safe Mode (SFW) on when
applicable.</p>
<p>C) Core business definitions (v1)</p>
<p>These are the canonical definitions the catalog will encode.</p>
<p>GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) — buyer spend on services excluding
buyer fee, taxes, and studio deposits.<br />
Formula (LBG grain):<br />
gmv_cents = subtotal_cents + addons_total_cents + travel_total_cents +
license_total_cents from gold.fact_lbg.<br />
Notes: deposits are not GMV; refunds tracked separately.</p>
<p>Platform Revenue (Bookings) — provider fee + buyer fee (before
processor costs).<br />
Formula: provider_fee_cents + buyer_fee_cents allocated from
gold.fact_payment into gold.fact_booking_leg then summed.<br />
Variant: Net Booking Revenue = Platform Revenue − processor fees −
invalidclick credits (bookingrelated, if any).</p>
<p>Take Rate (%) — platform_revenue / GMV.<br />
Variants: bookingonly vs. all (booking + promotions + early payout
fees).</p>
<p>Bookings — count of completed legs (status completed).<br />
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg.</p>
<p>Cancellations (rate) — cancels ÷ requests at leg grain; split by
buyerinitiated vs providerinitiated; policy band segments.<br />
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg (status='canceled' and
policy_band_on_cancel).</p>
<p>Acceptance Rate — accepts ÷ (accepts + declines) for provider;
rolespecific; controlled for Instant Book.<br />
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg events rollup (or derived from booking
status transitions).</p>
<p>Search→Inquiry Conversion — inquiries opened ÷ search result clicks
(same role/city/day).<br />
Where: gold.fact_search + messaging opens leading to a thread
(msg.thread_open).</p>
<p>Inquiry→Booking Conversion — booking requests ÷ inquiries
(threadlinked).<br />
Where: gold.fact_thread_activity + gold.fact_booking_leg.</p>
<p>Ontime Delivery Rate — legs that hit deliverables window ÷ completed
legs.<br />
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg (accepted_at ≤ due_at derived).</p>
<p>Safety Report Rate — T&amp;S cases per 1,000 completed legs; severity
buckets.<br />
Where: gold.fact_ts_case + gold.fact_booking_leg.</p>
<p>Payout Latency — median days from completed_at →
payout_sent_at.<br />
Where: gold.fact_booking_leg + gold.fact_payout_leg.</p>
<p>Promotions Spend (Boost/Featured) — CPC clicks valid (Boost) + weekly
fees (Featured).<br />
Where: gold.fact_promo.</p>
<p>CPB (Cost per Booking) — promo_spend / attributed_bookings.<br />
Incremental CPB: promo_spend / incremental_bookings via holdout.</p>
<p>ROAS — gmv_attributed / promo_spend; Incremental ROAS uses
gmv_incremental_cents.</p>
<p>Rep Decile Share — distribution of bookings by provider Rep Score
decile.<br />
Where: join gold.fact_booking_leg →
gold.dim_service_profile.rep_score_role.</p>
<p>Tax Collected — Σ tax_cents from gold.fact_tax (jurisdiction
breakdowns).</p>

<p>Notes: The actual implementation can live in a metrics framework;
YAML shown for clarity.</p>
<p>E) Semantic layer (views/API) — how it protects us</p>
<p>Conformed dimensions: Expose a single dim_time (day/week/month),
dim_city, dim_role, dim_service_profile, dim_campaign so all metrics
“slice” the same way.</p>
<p>Guardrails:</p>
<p>LBG vs leg: The layer blocks queries that mix LBGgrain money (GMV)
with leggrain fields without a safe join path; it proposes an allowed
rollup (e.g., aggregate legs first).</p>
<p>Attribution filters: Promotions metrics require promotion_campaign_id
or type; you can’t ask for ROAS without a campaign context.</p>
<p>Privacy: Queries that try to expose PII columns from vault are
denied; only masked views are available (gold_restricted).</p>
<p>Ratios: When you add dimensions, the semantic layer recomputes ratios
properly (numerator/denominator recomputed at the new grain).</p>
<p>APIs:</p>
<p>/metrics/query accepts: metric keys, time grain, allowed
dimensions/filters, and returns typed series with definition_hash and
catalog_version.</p>
<p>/metrics/inspect returns the SQL and upstream lineage for any metric
key@version.</p>
<p>F) Tests &amp; data quality (per metric)</p>
<p>Definition tests: Nonnegative money, denominators not zero,
reconciliation to settlements for finance metrics.</p>
<p>Drift tests: Compare latest week vs prior week distribution; alert on
large swings (beyond set thresholds).</p>
<p>Freshness: Every metric key declares its expected freshness (ops ≤15
min; finance daily 06:00). Dashboards show a freshness badge.</p>
<p>G) Versioning &amp; change management</p>
<p>Semver per metric: gmv_cents@1.0.0 → add fields or improve logic →
1.1.0. Breaking definition changes → new key (e.g.,
gmv_cents_excl_travel@1.0.0).</p>
<p>Deprecation: Dashboards show “this tile uses v1.0.0; v1.1.0
available.” Migration windows and change notes documented.</p>
<p>Owner required: Each metric has an owner team; CI blocks unowned
metrics or edits without owner approval.</p>
<p>H) Allowed dimensions (starter set)</p>
<p>Time: dt, week, month</p>
<p>Geo: city_id, state, tier</p>
<p>Role: service_role, leg_role</p>
<p>Identity (masked): service_profile_id, user_id (provider/buyer) —
only in restricted views</p>
<p>Channels: platform (web/ios/android), promotion_campaign_id, type
(boost/featured)</p>
<p>Policy: policy_band_on_cancel, instant_book</p>
<p>Trust: rep_decile, id_verified, trusted_pro</p>
<p>The catalog rejects adhoc dimensions that break grain or privacy.</p>

<p>J) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.6 FINAL)</p>
<p>Metrics Catalog created with owners, grains, definitions, tests, and
semver.</p>
<p>Semantic layer exposes curated measures/dims, blocks unsafe joins,
recomputes ratios correctly, and masks PII.</p>
<p>Core keys live: gmv_cents, platform_revenue_cents, take_rate_pct,
bookings_count, cancellations_rate, acceptance_rate_pct,
search_to_inquiry_pct, inquiry_to_booking_pct, on_time_delivery_pct,
safety_reports_per_1k, payout_latency_median_days, promo_spend_cents,
cpb_cents, roas, roas_incremental, rep_decile_share,
tax_collected_cents.</p>
<p>Tests &amp; freshness badges wired to §4.14.12; definition hash shown
on tiles.</p>
<p>Versioning and deprecation documented; CI blocks metric edits without
owner approval.</p>
<p>K) Why this works</p>
<p>One language for money, growth, and safety reduces debate and
accelerates decisions.</p>
<p>The semantic layer prevents subtle errors (double counts, bad ratios,
PII leaks).</p>
<p>Versioning &amp; tests let us evolve definitions without breaking
dashboards.</p>
<p>§5.7 — Privacy, PII &amp; Retention</p>
<p>Goal: Keep user data private, minimal, and auditable while still
powering analytics, payouts, safety, and growth. Enforce strict
separation of raw PII, short retentions on noisy logs, and clear unmask
workflows with timeboxed approvals. All choices align with USonly launch
and decisions in §4.12–§4.14 &amp; §5.0–§5.6.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Principles</p>
<p>USonly data residency at launch; all primary storage and backups in
US regions.</p>
<p>Minimize &amp; mask: Capture the least necessary; store tokens
instead of raw identifiers; mask by default.</p>
<p>Purposebound: Use data only for defined product/ops purposes;
anything else needs Legal signoff.</p>
<p>Defense in depth: Contracts (§5.1) + vault isolation (§5.4) + RBAC
(§4.14.1) + retention (§4.14.15) + DLP scans.</p>
<p>No minors: Platform is 18+. KYC/ID returns an “18+ verified” flag; we
do not keep DOB in analytics layers.</p>
<p>B) Data Classification (privacy tiers)</p>
<p>Rule: Raw emails/phones/addresses/SSNs are never in events or Gold.
Only tokens &amp; IDs flow through analytics.</p>
<p>C) PII Handling Patterns</p>
<p>Tokenization at ingest (edge collector):</p>
<p>Email → email_token (salted hash + surrogate key).</p>
<p>Phone → phone_token.</p>
<p>Address → address_token (if needed for payouts).</p>
<p>Tokens are irreversible outside the vault.</p>
<p>Vault_PII (separate schema &amp; keys):</p>
<p>Tables: vault_pii.user_contact, vault_pii.tax_forms,
vault_pii.background_artifacts.</p>
<p>Columnlevel encryption (KMS), access only to Legal/Tax under RBAC +
JIT elevation.</p>
<p>Unmask flow (operational necessity only):</p>
<p>Admin requests JustInTime elevation with reason + case/ticket
(§4.14.1).</p>
<p>Timeboxed key to run a scoped unmask function (e.g., contact a user
for payouts/chargeback).</p>
<p>Twoperson approval for tax/background artifacts and bulk unmask.</p>
<p>All accesses logged in a PII access ledger with user, reason,
columns, counts.</p>
<p>Masking in UI/exports:</p>
<p>Masked by default (j***@mail.com, (***) ***1234).</p>
<p>All CSV/PDF exports watermarked with requester, timestamp, definition
hash, and query id.</p>
<p>D) Access Control &amp; Environments</p>
<p>RBAC by role &amp; scope (see §4.14.1).</p>
<p>Rowlevel security for contractors by city_id if needed.</p>
<p>Separate SSO realms for Sandbox vs Prod (see §4.14.16).</p>
<p>Notebook policy: Analysts use gold_restricted via the semantic layer;
no direct vault access.</p>
<p>E) Consent, Notices &amp; Purpose Limitation</p>
<p>Clickwrap logs (ToS/Privacy) with version, IP/device, and timestamp
(see §4.14.15 G).</p>
<p>Edelivery consent for tax forms stored in vault; indicator mirrored
in Gold (edelivery_consent=true).</p>
<p>Marketing optout respected in messaging systems; flags exposed in
Gold as masked booleans for segmentation (no emails exported).</p>
<p>No secondary use: Any new purpose (e.g., external data sharing)
triggers a privacy review and Legal approval.</p>
<p>F) Retention &amp; Deletion (USfirst)</p>
<p>Retention profiles (aligned with §4.14.15 D; enforced by purge engine
with a nightly job and a purge ledger):</p>
<p>Deletion (DSR) rules (see §4.14.15 E):</p>
<p>When eligible: remove public content, mask profile, stop
discoverability; preserve finance/tax and any held records.</p>
<p>Tombstones replace names in historic receipts/threads.</p>
<p>Coolingoff window (e.g., 14 days) before irreversible purge.</p>
<p>G) DeIdentification &amp; Aggregate Sharing</p>
<p>kanonymity thresholds for public/marketing aggregates (e.g., k ≥ 15);
suppress small cells.</p>
<p>Noise injection (±1–3%) optional for externally shared rate
metrics.</p>
<p>No raw media or NSFW content in public datasets; thumbnails only,
watermarked.</p>
<p>H) Encryption, Keys &amp; Secrets</p>
<p>In transit: TLS everywhere; mTLS for admin pipelines.</p>
<p>At rest: Serverside encryption for all buckets/tables; envelope
encryption for vault fields.</p>
<p>Key management: KMS with annual rotation; breakglass policy with dual
approval and full audit.</p>
<p>Secrets: Stored in a dedicated secrets manager; rotated quarterly or
on incident.</p>
<p>I) DLP &amp; Monitoring</p>
<p>Nightly DLP scans on Bronze/Silver/Gold for forbidden patterns
(emails, SSNs, card PANs).</p>
<p>Alerting to Observability (§4.14.13) on detection; repeat detections
escalate (autoquarantine offending tables).</p>
<p>Outbound controls: Email/SMS gateways block messages containing raw
PII pasted by agents; Admin redaction tool available (§4.14.1 E).</p>
<p>J) ML &amp; Analytics Privacy</p>
<p>Feature store uses Gold; no direct vault fields in features.</p>
<p>Fairness &amp; privacy review for new models (ranking, risk).</p>
<p>Model cards record training data ranges, features used, evaluation
slices, and privacy notes; ml.prediction events include version and
feature hashes (§5.11).</p>
<p>PII in training notebooks prohibited; static analysis checks for
vault joins.</p>
<p>K) Audits &amp; Incident Response</p>
<p>PII access ledger: who, when, what columns, counts, reason, ticket
id; weekly digest to Privacy.</p>
<p>Data incidents: Runbook in §4.14.13—containment, scope, user comms
template, regulator threshold checks (US context), rootcause and CAPA
items.</p>
<p>External requests: handled through Legal intake (§4.14.15); gag
orders recorded and honored.</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.7 FINAL)</p>
<p>Privacy tiers wired into ingest; events with forbidden PII blocked at
edge.</p>
<p>Vault_PII schema live with column encryption, RBAC, and JIT unmask +
twoperson approvals.</p>
<p>Maskbydefault everywhere (UI, exports); watermarking of downloads
enabled.</p>
<p>Retention engine enforces schedules; purge ledger populated; legal
holds pause deletes.</p>
<p>DSR flows (access/export, deletion, optout) operational and logged;
tombstones applied on deletion.</p>
<p>DLP scans nightly with alerts; repeat violations autoquarantine.</p>
<p>Data residency set to US; keys managed via KMS with rotation; secrets
manager in place.</p>
<p>Analyst access constrained to gold_restricted + semantic layer; vault
denied by default.</p>
<p>ML privacy guardrails enforced: no vault joins in features; model
cards captured.</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Least data, most value: We keep only what we need, as long as we need
it, where it’s safest.</p>
<p>Operationally practical: Unmask flows are rare, justified, timeboxed,
and audited—yet Support/Tax can do their work.</p>
<p>Auditable &amp; defensible: Clear ledgers, purge logs, and DLP alarms
prove compliance in audits and incidents.</p>
<p>Futureproof: USfirst, but patterns (vault, tiers, retention) scale to
stricter regimes if we expand later.</p>
<p>Policy Free Reschedule Cancellation Refunds</p>

<p>Change Who can initiate Needs Buyer Acceptance? Notes /
Guardrails</p>
<p>Reschedule (date/time) Provider or Buyer Yes (unless autoapprove
rule) Creates an Amendment; updates calendars &amp; ICS; preserves
policy &amp; price unless changed.</p>
<p>Minor Time Shift (≤ X mins same day) Provider Autoapprove optional
Buyer may set autoapprove window (e.g., ±30 minutes); otherwise prompts
acceptance.</p>
<p>Location Change (within Y miles) Provider/Buyer Yes If it affects
travel fees, system recalculates; provider cannot unilaterally increase
cost.</p>
<p>Extend/Shorten Duration Provider/Buyer Extend → Yes, Shorten → No
(refund only) Extension uses Overtime action card; shortening allows
partial refund by provider.</p>
<p>Package Change (tier swap) Provider Yes Provider proposes a different
package; pricing &amp; deliverables update on acceptance.</p>
<p>Add Extras / License Upgrade Provider/Buyer Yes Standard “Add Extras”
action; incremental charge on acceptance.</p>
<p>Discount / Price Decrease Provider No Provider may apply discount or
issue partial refund unilaterally; instant escrow adjustment +
notification.</p>
<p>Price Increase (base) Provider Yes Must be sent as Custom Offer
Amendment; buyer must accept; otherwise original terms stand.</p>
<p>Travel Fee Adjust (downward) Provider No Providers can waive or
reduce travel; cannot raise without buyer acceptance.</p>
<p>Refund (full/partial) Provider No Refund to buyer reduces escrow or,
postpayout, triggers provider debit; see §4.</p>

<p>§5.8 — Data Quality &amp; Testing</p>
<p>Goal: Guarantee that everything built on our data—dashboards,
payouts, taxes, safety actions, experiments—rests on correct, fresh,
privacysafe tables. Detect issues early, quarantine safely, block
sensitive outputs when needed, and make fixes auditable and
repeatable.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Objectives</p>
<p>Where we test: SDK/Edge → Bus → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Semantic
layer (metrics) → BI/Exports.</p>
<p>What we test: Contracts, IDs &amp; referential integrity, business
invariants, money &amp; reconciliations, freshness &amp; completeness,
privacy &amp; masking, anomaly baselines.</p>
<p>How we act: Quarantine bad records, gate finance close, flag
dashboards, and page owners with clear runbooks.</p>
<p>B) Layered Check Matrix (who/when/what)</p>
<p>C) Test Categories &amp; Examples (starter suite)</p>
<p>1) Contract &amp; Schema Tests (events)</p>
<p>Required fields present; types correct (money = int cents).</p>
<p>Enums valid: leg_role ∈ {talent, studio}; method ∈ {card, ach}.</p>
<p>No forbidden PII: raw email/phone/address; block at edge (already in
§5.1/§5.7).</p>
<p>Example (Edge validator rule)</p>
<p>If payload.email present → reject and log data.ingest.deny:
forbidden_pii.</p>
<p>2) Identity &amp; Referential Integrity</p>
<p>Every booking_leg_id in Silver must have a service_profile_id,
buyer_user_id, and city_id.</p>
<p>Every charge_id in Gold lines maps to an lbg_id and to existing legs
for line allocation.</p>
<p>No orphan docs: doc_id must reference an existing booking_leg_id.</p>
<p>Check SQL (Silver → Gold)</p>
<p>SELECT COUNT(*) AS orphan_legs</p>
<p>FROM silver.fin_events f</p>
<p>LEFT JOIN gold.fact_booking_leg b ON f.booking_leg_id =
b.booking_leg_id</p>
<p>WHERE f.event_name LIKE 'fin.%' AND b.booking_leg_id IS NULL;</p>
<p>Threshold: orphan_legs = 0 (P1 if &gt;0).</p>
<p>3) Business Invariants</p>
<p>Time windows: start_at &lt; end_at; accepted_at ≤ due_at (when
deliverables due).</p>
<p>Status transitions: No illegal jumps (e.g., declined →
completed).</p>
<p>NSFW guard: When Safe Mode off for a buyer, paid placements must
still respect policy flags.</p>
<p>4) Money &amp; Reconciliation</p>
<p>Charge lines sum: Σ fact_payment_line.line_cents =
fact_payment.amount_cents.</p>
<p>Leg allocations: Σ perleg allocations (buyer_fee, tax, processor) =
parent totals (tolerance ≤ 1 cent per charge).</p>
<p>Payouts: Σ fact_payout_leg.net_to_provider_cents =
fact_payout.amount_cents.</p>
<p>Settlements recon: Daily Σ charges/refunds vs processor settlement
file (variance ≤ 0.5%).</p>
<p>Deposits: auth &gt;= capture + (void | release); no negative
balances.</p>
<p>5) Freshness &amp; Completeness</p>
<p>Ops freshness: Silver tables lag &lt; 15 min (p95).</p>
<p>Finance close: Gold finance complete by 06:00 local.</p>
<p>Completeness: For each day/city, # of completed legs in Gold ≥ 99% of
Silver by 07:00 (after late arrivals).</p>
<p>6) Privacy &amp; Masking</p>
<p>Masked by default: Emails/phones in Gold must equal masked pattern;
verify no raw patterns via DLP scan.</p>
<p>Vault joins: Blocked in analyst contexts; any query touching
vault_pii.* outside Tax/Legal → alert + deny.</p>
<p>7) Statistical/Anomaly Baselines</p>
<p>Click invalid rate (Boost): expected &lt; 7%; &gt; 15% triggers P1
investigation.</p>
<p>Zero result rate spikes: baseline + 3σ; flag search regressions.</p>
<p>Rep score distribution weekly drift: JensenShannon distance &gt;
threshold → review scoring pipeline.</p>
<p>Unit economics: Take rate dayoverday delta &gt; 2 p.p. → notify
Finance &amp; Growth.</p>
<p>8) Metrics Catalog Consistency (from §5.6)</p>
<p>Tile definition hash must match catalog; if not, show “Definition
changed” banner.</p>
<p>Ratios recomputed at query grain; no avgofaverages allowed (semantic
guard).</p>
<p>D) Severity &amp; Gating (what we block vs warn)</p>
<p>Gating rules:</p>
<p>Finance close blocked on P0 money checks; release requires signoff
from Finance lead.</p>
<p>Payouts job pauses automatically if negative net or variance
breaches.</p>
<p>Promotions autothrottle if invalid clicks breach P1 threshold.</p>
<p>E) Ownership, Frequency &amp; Tooling</p>
<p>Ascode tests in repo (/dq/), versioned with data pipelines; owners:
Data Eng (pipelines), Finance (money rules), Analytics (semantic tests),
Privacy (PII/DLP).</p>
<p>Schedules:</p>
<p>Edge/Silver: continuous;</p>
<p>Gold finance: nightly;</p>
<p>Catalog/semantic: nightly + on deploy;</p>
<p>DLP: nightly;</p>
<p>Baselines: daily/weekly jobs.</p>
<p>Dashboards: Admin Analytics cockpit (§4.14.12) shows DQ status:
red/amber/green per table/metric; freshness gauges; recon variances; DLQ
counts.</p>
<p>Alerts: Slack + email routes from Observability (§4.14.13) with
runbook links.</p>
<p>F) Example Tests (per table)</p>
<p>gold.fact_booking_leg</p>
<p>start_at &lt; end_at</p>
<p>status ∈ enum and legal transitions only</p>
<p>leg_role='studio' ⇒ deposit_auth_cents may be nonnull;
leg_role='talent' ⇒ deposit fields must be null</p>
<p>Σ allocations equals parent charge totals (join to

<p>Dims (SCD2)</p>
<p>No overlapping valid_from/valid_to for the same natural key; exactly
one current_flag=true</p>
<p>G) Freshness &amp; Completeness Monitors</p>
<p>Table freshness: materialized view of max updated_at per table;
redline if &gt;15 min for Silver ops tables.</p>
<p>Completeness: compare counts of completed legs in Silver vs Gold by
city/day after finance close; badge tiles if &lt;99%.</p>
<p>H) Quarantine, Replays &amp; Fix Flow (tie to §5.9)</p>
<p>Quarantine families: schema_violation, fk_missing, money_invariant,
privacy_violation.</p>
<p>Replay: after a fix (schema or code), reprocess quarantined batches
via Replay Tool; Gold recomputes only affected partitions.</p>
<p>Audit: all quarantines, replays, and manual overrides logged and
surfaced in Admin analytics.</p>
<p>I) Documentation &amp; Training</p>
<p>DQ runbooks for each P0/P1 failure with example queries, expected
impacts, and rollback steps.</p>
<p>Sandbox drills (§4.14.16): quarterly exercises for finance close
gate, promotions invalidclick spike, and freshness outage.</p>
<p>J) Telemetry (DQ events)</p>
<p>dq.schema.fail/pass (event_name, version)</p>
<p>dq.fk_missing (table, count) • dq.invariant.fail (rule_id)</p>
<p>dq.recon.variance (cents) • dq.freshness.breach (table, minutes)</p>
<p>dq.dlp.hit (pattern, table) • dq.quarantine.enqueue/resolve</p>
<p>dq.gate.close.block/release (reason, approver)</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.8 FINAL)</p>
<p>Layered checks implemented from Edge → BI; failures categorized with
DLQs/quarantine.</p>
<p>Finance recon and allocation math tests gate daily close; payouts
pause on P0s.</p>
<p>Freshness monitors (&lt;15 min Silver; finance done by 06:00) with
alerts &amp; tiles badges.</p>
<p>Referential &amp; invariant tests cover all core facts/dims; SCD2
overlap checks live.</p>
<p>Privacy/DLP scans nightly; exports watermarked; vault joins blocked
for analysts.</p>
<p>Baseline anomaly detectors active (invalid clicks, CTR, take rate,
rep distribution).</p>
<p>Replay tool integrated with quarantine; partial recompute only; all
actions audited.</p>
<p>DQ dashboard in Admin shows status, trends, and links to
runbooks.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Prevents silent errors from creeping into payouts, taxes, and
KPIs.</p>
<p>Gives teams clear gates and playbooks, so fixes are fast and
traceable.</p>
<p>Keeps trust high with Finance and operators by reconciling to reality
every day.</p>
<p>§5.9 — Backfills &amp; Replays</p>
<p>Goal: Correct history safely, audibly, and cheaply—whether fixing a
bug, adopting a new schema, filling late data, or reclosing
finance—without double counting, breaking joins, or violating
privacy/retention policies.</p>
<p>A) When to Replay vs Backfill (choose the right tool)</p>
<p>B) Event Replay Policy (Bronzefirst, idempotent)</p>
<p>What it does<br />
Replays original events through the current pipeline so new
parsing/enrichment applies.</p>
<p>How</p>
<p>Replay Tool accepts event_name, date range, optional ids
(booking_leg_id, lbg_id, user_id).</p>
<p>Finds events in archived Bronze (≤90day hot, longer in cold storage)
→ republishes to Event Bus with headers: replayed_at=&lt;ts&gt;; payload
is unchanged.</p>
<p>Idempotency:</p>
<p>If the original event_id is available, reuse it → Bronze sink stores
a shadow row with replay=true (kept for audit), Silver/Gold upserts
deterministically by natural keys (e.g., event_id or leg/line keys).</p>
<p>If original event_id was missing/invalid, the replay assigns a stable
synthetic key derived from the original record hash.</p>
<p>Guardrails</p>
<p>Scope preview shows row counts and blast radius (downstream tables
via lineage).</p>
<p>Dryrun computes deltas (counts, money sums) without writing.</p>
<p>Privacy tiers respected—no new PII appears.</p>
<p>Freeze windows: during finance close, heavy replays are queued.</p>
<p>C) Backfill Manager (Admin UI/CLI workflow)</p>
<p>1) Define the job</p>
<p>Type: Silver fix / Gold finance reclose / SCD2 rebuild / Promotions
recompute / Tax refresh.</p>
<p>Scope: date range, city(ies), role(s), entity filters (ids).</p>
<p>Mode: dryrun → plan; then execute.</p>
<p>2) Plan output</p>
<p>Tables to recompute, row estimates, money impact (pre vs post),
dependencies (lineage graph).</p>
<p>Runtime and cost estimates; throttling plan.</p>
<p>3) Execute</p>
<p>Chunked by day×city; idempotent merges with checkpointing; failure
autoresume.</p>
<p>Writes job_id to every affected row (adjustment_job_id) for
audit.</p>
<p>4) Review &amp; finalize</p>
<p>Diff report: row deltas, GMV/Revenue/Tax variances, counts by
status.</p>
<p>Signoff gates (Finance for money, Privacy for sensitive scopes).</p>
<p>Publish change notes to Data Catalog &amp; Metric Catalog.</p>
<p>D) Scoping Impact: lineagebased blast radius</p>
<p>Use table lineage (from §5.4 I) to enumerate downstream objects that
will change (facts, materialized views, dashboards).</p>
<p>Compute metric deltas for catalog keys (from §5.6) in the selected
window: GMV, platform revenue, take rate, tax, CPB/ROAS if promotions
touched.</p>
<p>Flag locked periods (e.g., monthly revenue closed) and switch to
Adjustment Ledger (see G).</p>
<p>E) Idempotency &amp; Dedup (how we avoid double counts)</p>
<p>Bronze keeps both original and replay shadows; Silver upserts by
natural keys (e.g., event_id or (charge_id,line_no)).</p>
<p>Gold facts use stable keys (booking_leg_id, charge_id, payout_id,
promotion_campaign_id,dt) and overwrite the partition
deterministically.</p>
<p>Rerunning the same job with the same scope does not change totals
(idempotent by key).</p>
<p>Compensating events are not required; we prefer deterministic
recompute over appendonly corrections in analytics.</p>
<p>F) SCD2 Rebuilds &amp; “AsOf” correctness</p>
<p>For dim_service_profile, dim_user, dim_policy, rebuild SCD2 from CDC
(silver.dim_*_cdc) maintaining valid_from/valid_to.</p>
<p>Rebuild ensures no overlaps, exactly one current_flag=true.</p>
<p>Pointintime queries (e.g., price at booking time) are guaranteed by
joining on occurred_at BETWEEN valid_from AND valid_to.</p>
<p>Policy/version drift handled: facts carry policy_id used at the time;
rebuild does not swap historic policy ids.</p>
<p>G) Gold Finance Reclose &amp; Adjustment Ledger</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>Allocation bug, settlement corrections, tax provider fix, deposit
handling fix, ACH fee miscalc, etc.</p>
<p>How</p>
<p>Lock the target period (e.g., a cityday or full month).</p>
<p>Recompute fact_payment, fact_booking_leg, fact_payout, fact_tax,
fact_deposit for the scope.</p>
<p>If the period is preclose → overwrite facts (idempotent) and publish
diffs.</p>
<p>If postclose (books closed):</p>
<p>Do not overwrite; write to gold.fact_adjustment_ledger with:
adjustment_id, scope, reason_code, delta_cents by line type (gmv,
provider fee, buyer fee, processor fee, tax, payout).</p>
<p>The semantic layer uses facts + Σ adjustments for reporting in
“current view” and exposes a “asreported at date” mode for audit.</p>
<p>Controls</p>
<p>Finance signoff required to post adjustments; job artifacts
archived.</p>
<p>H) Privacy, Holds &amp; Compliance</p>
<p>Legal holds (from §4.14.15) prevent mutation/purge of held rows;
backfill manager skips them and logs.</p>
<p>Retention respected: do not reload Bronze older than configured
unless Legal approves.</p>
<p>PII: backfills never move raw PII into Gold; vault schemas
unchanged.</p>
<p>Tax: 1099 figures recomputed only within the tax year open window;
else use Adjustment Ledger with memo.</p>
<p>I) Performance, Throttling &amp; Cost</p>
<p>Chunking: day×city (or campaign×day) pieces; parallelism capped to
protect warehouse SLOs.</p>
<p>Priority levels: S1 (finance/tax) preempts; S2 (product fixes)
scheduled offpeak; S3 (perf remats) background only.</p>
<p>Materializations: dependent MVs refreshed incrementally; caches
invalidated in scope only.</p>
<p>Rate limits: replay to bus has QPS caps and backpressure; retries
exponential.</p>
<p>J) QA/Diff &amp; Signoff</p>
<p>Before/After reports: counts (bookings, legs), money (GMV, fees,
payouts, tax), promotions KPIs for affected windows.</p>
<p>Tolerance thresholds: finance variances must go to exact zero in
reclose; product metrics allow tiny drift only if expected by bug fix
(documented).</p>
<p>Dashboards display “Data Updated by Backfill JOBID” badges for the
date range with link to change note.</p>
<p>Rollback: jobs are rerunnable; use prior snapshot (timetravel) or
inverse adjustments for postclose periods.</p>
<p>K) Telemetry (Backfill/Replay events)</p>
<p>data.replay.start/finish/fail (event_name, range, rows)</p>
<p>data.backfill.plan/execute/finish/fail (job_id, scope, tables, rows,
runtime)</p>
<p>data.backfill.diff (job_id, metric_key, delta_cents/counts)</p>
<p>data.finance.reclose.start/finish (scope) •
data.adjustment_ledger.post (amounts)</p>
<p>data.lineage.impact (job_id, downstream_objects)</p>
<p>data.freeze_window.enter/exit (reason)</p>
<p>L) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.9 FINAL)</p>
<p>Replay Tool reads archived Bronze, republishes with replayed_at, and
maintains idempotency; dryrun diff available.</p>
<p>Backfill Manager supports Silver fixes, Gold reclose, SCD2 rebuilds,
promotions/tax recompute; shows plan, costs, lineage, and diffs.</p>
<p>Gold finance reclose implemented with freeze windows and Adjustment
Ledger for postclose corrections.</p>
<p>All operations obey privacy/retention/holds; skipped rows logged.</p>
<p>Chunked execution with checkpoints; resumable on failure; performance
quotas enforced.</p>
<p>Diff reports and catalog change notes autopublished; dashboards badge
updated ranges.</p>
<p>Telemetry &amp; runbooks wired; Finance/Privacy signoffs required
where applicable.</p>
<p>Idempotency proven: rerunning the same job is a noop (byteforbyte or
centsforcents parity).</p>
<p>M) Why this works</p>
<p>Keeps history correct without breaking audits or inflating
metrics.</p>
<p>Provides surgical tools (replay vs backfill) with guardrails and
signoffs.</p>
<p>Honors privacy &amp; retention, while giving Finance and Product
confidence that fixes stick</p>
<p>§5.10 — External Systems &amp; Lineage</p>
<p>Goal: Integrate thirdparty services (payments, tax, ID/background,
social metrics, content safety, esignature, comms) through strict
adapters and contracts so every external input/output is traceable,
auditable, and LBGaware—and any dashboard number can be traced back to
its upstream source.</p>
<p>A) Systems Map &amp; Roles (USonly launch)</p>
<p>Money</p>
<p>Payment Processor (card + ACH + 3DS, disputes, payouts): e.g.,
Stripe/Adyenclass.</p>
<p>Tax Engine (sales tax determination): Avalara/TaxJarclass (US
servicestax, city addons).</p>
<p>Bank/KYC/KYB: via payment processor hosted flows.</p>
<p>Trust</p>
<p>ID Verification: Persona/Onfido/Veriffclass (18+ check,
liveness).</p>
<p>Background Checks (FCRA): Checkr/Sterlingclass (USonly roles;
optin).</p>
<p>Growth &amp; Safety</p>
<p>Social Metrics: IG Graph, YouTube Data, TikTok, X; Phase2: LinkedIn
Pages, FB Pages, Snapchat Public Profile.</p>
<p>Content Safety Scan: VisionAPIclass (image/video nudity/explicit
heuristic).</p>
<p>ESignature: DocuSign/DropboxSignclass (SOW, Releases, House
Rules).</p>
<p>Comms: Email (SendGridclass), SMS (Twilioclass), Push (FCM/APNs).</p>
<p>Storage/Deliverables</p>
<p>External links (Drive/Dropbox) + local uploads
(thumbnails/proofs).</p>
<p>Each adapter emits/consumes versioned events per §5.1 and writes to
Bronze → Silver → Gold per §5.3–§5.5.</p>
<p>B) Integration Pattern (Adapter Contract)</p>
<p>Adapter rules (all vendors)</p>
<p>One adapter = one bounded context, versioned (adapter_version),
with:</p>
<p>Synchronous API calls (idempotent keys).</p>
<p>Webhook listener (verified signatures; replay protection).</p>
<p>Polling fallback (for missed webhooks).</p>
<p>Identifiers: store vendor ids as external_ref columns
(processor_charge_id, tax_txn_id, idv_verification_id, etc.).</p>
<p>Event mapping: every webhook → ext.&lt;domain&gt;.webhook_received,
then internal normalized events (e.g., fin.checkout_pay_success).</p>
<p>Retries: exponential backoff, max 24h. Idempotent by natural
keys.</p>
<p>Security: OAuth/scoped API keys in Vault; peradapter RBAC; allowlist
IPs for webhooks; mTLS for admin callbacks.</p>
<p>Observability: latency, error rate, backlog gauges; synthetic tests
(see §4.14.13).</p>
<p>SLA tags: adapter_sla_tier (S1 money, S2 trust, S3 analytics).</p>
<p>C) Payments &amp; Payouts Adapter (S1)</p>
<p>Capabilities</p>
<p>Card auth/capture, 3DS challenge, ACH debit; refunds/partial
refunds.</p>
<p>Disputes/chargebacks lifecycle; evidence uploads.</p>
<p>Payouts with reserves; bank verification (KYC/KYB).</p>
<p>Data flow</p>
<p>Checkout calls processor with lbg_id, amount, idempotency key →
returns processor_charge_id.</p>
<p>Webhook: charge.succeeded/failed, dispute.opened/closed,
payout.paid/failed.</p>
<p>Normalize to §5.1 events: fin.checkout_pay_success/fail,
fin.refund_apply, fin.payout_*.</p>
<p>Gold reconciliation: fact_payment, fact_payout (see §5.5), tie to
settlements in §5.3.</p>
<p>Edge cases</p>
<p>ACH returns (R01/R07...): mapped to fin.checkout_pay_fail with code →
autocancel leg per policy.</p>
<p>Split payments (rare): still one charge_id per LBG; lineitems
allocate across legs.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>3DS indicators stored; PAN never touches our systems; tokens
only.</p>
<p>D) Tax Adapter (S1 for Finance, S2 for Ops)</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>At checkout (quote), at amendments (change orders), and on
refunds.</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Request: lbg_id, origin/destination (city/state), taxable base, role
(talent/studio).</p>
<p>Response: tax cents, jurisdiction codes, latency; store
tax_txn_id.</p>
<p>Webhook/poll: provider status changes (rate updates/errors).</p>
<p>Tables</p>
<p>gold.fact_tax line per calc; joins to fact_payment.</p>
<p>Failover: if calc down ⇒ show buyer banner “tax delayed,” proceed
only where legally safe (setting in §4.14.7).</p>
<p>E) ID Verification Adapter (S2)</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Hosted KYC: user launches flow → idv_verification_id → webhook status
(approved|refused|reupload).</p>
<p>Store flags (ID Verified true/false), selfie liveness score; no raw
docs in analytics.</p>
<p>Emits: ts.idv_submit, ts.idv_decision.</p>
<p>PII</p>
<p>Raw images/IDs in vendor; we store only tokens &amp; status (see
§5.7).</p>
<p>F) Background Check Adapter (S2, FCRA)</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Optin; collect consent; submit job with bg_check_id.</p>
<p>Webhook status: clear|consider|review_required.</p>
<p>Adverse action workflow in Admin (twostep notices).</p>
<p>Emits: ts.bg_submit, ts.bg_decision, ts.bg_adverse_action.</p>
<p>Compliance</p>
<p>Store report IDs &amp; statuses, not report contents; retention 5–7
years per §5.7.</p>
<p>G) Social Metrics Connectors (S2 analytics)</p>
<p>Platforms (Day1) IG, YouTube, TikTok, X (per §1.2 addendum).<br />
Flow</p>
<p>OAuth connect → nightly sync (30/90day growth, ER, followers, avg
views); manual refresh 3×/day.</p>
<p>Ratelimit aware; backoff on quota errors.</p>
<p>Emits: social.snapshot_pull, social.snapshot_store.</p>
<p>Writes to gold.fact_social_snapshot (verified flag).</p>
<p>Privacy</p>
<p>Tokens in Vault; scopes minimal (readonly insights).</p>
<p>H) Content Safety Scan (S2 safety)</p>
<p>What</p>
<p>Image/video classification (nudity/explicit/violence), OCR for text
overlays, unsafe keyword lists.</p>
<p>Used on: profile portfolio, public thumbnails, featured media (not
private Drive/Dropbox manifests).</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Upload → async scan → verdict (approve|quarantine|remove) with
confidence.</p>
<p>Emits: content.scan_request, content.moderation_decision.</p>
<p>Admin can override with reason; all logged.</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>Artistic nudity allowed; explicit sexual content blocked in public
areas; “Safe Mode” default for buyers (see §1.5 &amp; §4.5).</p>
<p>I) ESignature Adapter (S2)</p>
<p>Use</p>
<p>SOW (scope/pricing), Model Releases (roleaware), Studio House
Rules.</p>
<p>Flow</p>
<p>Template render → send envelope → webhook signed/declined/voided.</p>
<p>Emits: doc.sow_generate, doc.release_sign.</p>
<p>Store PDF hash, envelope id, signer ids; PDF in secure object store
(7year retention).</p>
<p>J) Comms Adapters (S2)</p>
<p>Email (transactional): receipts, payout notices, safety
messages.<br />
SMS: 2FA codes, critical booking updates.<br />
Push: new inquiry, timesensitive reminders.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>No raw PII beyond recipient; templating via Smart Docs CMS
(§4.14.10); unsubscribe/optout respected (flags in Gold).</p>
<p>K) Storage/Deliverables</p>
<p>Local uploads: thumbnails, small proofs; scanned by Content Safety;
stored with checksum.</p>
<p>External links: Drive/Dropbox manifests (name, size, checksum), not
mirrored to avoid cost; manifests used for disputes (§3.5).</p>
<p>L) Lineage: “Follow the money/decision” maps</p>
<p>Example 1 — A payout on a modeling leg</p>
<p>External: charge.succeeded → fin.checkout_pay_success (Bronze) →
Silver/Gold fact_payment.</p>
<p>Booking completes → fin.payout_queue/sent webhooks → fact_payout +
fact_payout_leg.</p>
<p>Dashboard tile “Provider earnings” references Gold facts; lineage
panel lists processor charge id, payout id, adapter_version.</p>
<p>Example 2 — ID Verified badge</p>
<p>idv.verification.completed webhook → ts.idv_decision (Silver) →
dim_user.id_verified=true (Gold SCD2).</p>
<p>Search ranking uses Rep &amp; verified flags; lineage shows vendor
decision + time.</p>
<p>Example 3 — Social ER filter</p>
<p>OAuth token → nightly pull social.snapshot_pull →
gold.fact_social_snapshot.</p>
<p>Search filter queries Gold; lineage includes platform, token scope,
last refresh.</p>
<p>M) SLAs, Monitoring &amp; Failover</p>
<p>Alerts route to Observability (§4.14.13) with runbooks.</p>
<p>N) Security &amp; Secrets</p>
<p>API keys/OAuth tokens in Vault; rotation schedules; scopes least
privilege.</p>
<p>Webhook HMAC signature checks; replayattack windows.</p>
<p>IP allowlists where supported; dedicated webhook endpoints per
adapter.</p>
<p>Encrypted logs for external callbacks; PII minimized.</p>
<p>O) Telemetry (external I/O events)</p>
<p>ext.payment.api_call (latency, status) •
ext.payment.webhook_received/verified</p>
<p>ext.tax.calc_request/response (latency, tax_cents)</p>
<p>ext.idv.webhook_received/decision •
ext.bg.webhook_received/decision</p>
<p>ext.social.pull.start/finish (platform, rows) •
ext.content.scan.request/decision</p>
<p>ext.esign.envelope.send/status • ext.comms.send.success/fail</p>
<p>All entries include adapter_version, external_ref,
lbg_id/booking_leg_id when relevant.</p>
<p>P) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.10 FINAL)</p>
<p>Each external system has a documented adapter (sync API + webhook +
polling fallback), versioned and emitting §5.1 events.</p>
<p>External refs stored (charge/payout/tax/idv/bg/social/esign ids) and
visible in Gold lineage columns.</p>
<p>Reconciliation pipelines tie payments/payouts/tax to settlements;
variance alerts live (§5.8).</p>
<p>Security: keys in Vault, HMAC webhook checks, IP allowlists,
leastscope OAuth, audit logs.</p>
<p>SLAs &amp; monitors per adapter; synthetic tests; failover behaviors
defined.</p>
<p>Content safety in place for public assets; quarantine path &amp;
admin override logged.</p>
<p>Esignature hooks populate doc hashes and status; PDFs retained 7
years.</p>
<p>Social metrics nightly/refresh flows populate fact_social_snapshot
with verified flag &amp; timestamps.</p>
<p>Lineage panel in Admin shows endtoend source→table for money and
trust decisions.</p>
<p>Q) Why this works</p>
<p>Clear adapter boundaries prevent vendor sprawl from leaking into core
logic.</p>
<p>Endtoend lineage lets Finance, Ops, and T&amp;S trust every number
and decision.</p>
<p>Strong security and PII minimization keep us compliant while still
useful.</p>
<p>SLAs + monitoring keep external outages from silently corrupting
analytics or UX.</p>
<p>Next up: §5.11 — ML Feature Store &amp; Modeling Hooks — define
feature views (ranking, risk, Smart Invites), offline/online parity,
training data contracts, model versioning, bias checks, and how
predictions roundtrip into events &amp; metrics.</p>
<p>§5.11 — ML Feature Store &amp; Modeling Hooks</p>
<p>Goal: Power ranking, recommendations, risk, and ops automation with
auditable, privacysafe ML. Ensure offline/online parity, clear feature
contracts, conservative guardrails (no paytowin, no FCRAsensitive
automation), and fast rollback. Models must measurably improve
Search→Inquiry→Booking without harming trust or fairness.</p>
<p>A) Decisions we’ll (carefully) augment with ML</p>
<p>Search Reranker (within organic slots only)<br />
Predict P(inquiry|query,card) and P(booking|inquiry,card); combine with
match score to rank organic results. Paid slots remain separately capped
(per §3.3).</p>
<p>Smart Invites (provider &amp; buyer)<br />
Suggest matches to message/book now; optimize for booking probability
and schedule fit (availability &amp; distance).</p>
<p>Promotions Quality Score<br />
For paid Boost ordering (within paid caps): predict expected CTR and
booking lift to weight bids (per §3.3 E).</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Reliability Signals<br />
Early warnings on likely noshows, late cancels, chargeback risk,
invalidclick rings (anomaly models feed §4.14.13 runbooks).</p>
<p>Guardrail: Risk models flag for human or policy rules; they do not
autosanction.</p>
<p>Price &amp; Package Hints (seller tools)<br />
Nonbinding suggestions: “Packages priced in the top 10% for your city
lead to 23% fewer inquiries.” No autopricing.</p>
<p>Message Triage Hints<br />
Classify intent/urgency to surface threads that likely convert soon;
never autorespond.</p>
<p>B) Offline/Online Architecture (Feature Store)</p>
<p>Offline (training)</p>
<p>Source: Gold facts &amp; dims (§5.5) joined pointintime (between
valid_from/valid_to) to prevent leakage.</p>
<p>Stored as feature views (parquet) with featureset_version and entity
keys: service_profile_id, buyer_user_id, city_id, dt.</p>
<p>Online (inference)</p>
<p>Lowlatency feature cache (KV store) keyed by (service_profile_id,
city_id) and (buyer_user_id).</p>
<p>TTLs per group (e.g., availability 5 min; social metrics 24 h; rep
score 1 h; reliability 24 h).</p>
<p>Backfill on miss: fall back to heuristics + minimal onthefly compute
(distance, schedule overlap).</p>
<p>Parity checks: nightly compare offline vs online distributions; drift
alarms (§5.8).</p>
<p>C) Feature Groups (PIIsafe, unitized)</p>
<p>Provider / Service Profile (roleaware)</p>
<p>rep_score_role (0–100), id_verified (bool), trusted_pro (bool),
instant_book (bool)</p>
<p>Pricing stats: price_min_cents, price_max_cents,
price_percentile_city_role</p>
<p>Performance: acceptance rate, completion rate, ontime delivery,
dispute rate (90day, 180day windows)</p>
<p>Availability density next 14 days; responsetime median (last 60
days)</p>
<p>Social: followers, avg views, ER (basis points), growth flags
(verified only flags)</p>
<p>Buyer</p>
<p>Historical spend decile, cancel rate, dispute rate, verified status,
ACH on file (ACH reduces buyer fee, a conversion lever)</p>
<p>Query intent features: budget percentile vs market, role searched,
NSFW preference state (policysafe)</p>
<p>Query &amp; Context</p>
<p>Role, city, distance (km), requested start/end (local time),
flexibility window, NSFW filter, license type</p>
<p>Market liquidity indicators (supply/demand index by
city/role/hour)</p>
<p>Interaction &amp; Graph</p>
<p>Prior collaborations (buyer↔︎provider), message history recency,
shortlists/boards presence</p>
<p>Studio (when applicable)</p>
<p>Studio verified (bool), deposit rule (percent/cap), amenity match
score, distance, availability</p>
<p>No raw PII (emails/phones/addresses). Sensitive attributes (e.g.,
gender, race) are not collected and must not be inferred.</p>
<p>D) Feature Contracts &amp; Storage</p>
<p>Schema: feature_key (string), featureset_version (semver),
entity_key(s), as_of_ts, columns of typed features.</p>
<p>Units: money in cents, times in minutes, percentages in basis
points.</p>
<p>Nulls: explicit defaults (e.g., -1 for unknown percentile); masks for
unavailable signals.</p>
<p>Docs: every feature has an owner, definition, refresh cadence, and
expected range.</p>
<p>E) Training Datasets &amp; Labels</p>
<p>Search Reranker</p>
<p>Positive labels: result clicks → inquiries; inquiries → accepted
bookings (separate heads or cascaded models).</p>
<p>Negatives: shown results not clicked or clicked but never
inquired/booked (biascontrolled with exposure logs).</p>
<p>Splits: timebased (train on T8w to T2w; validate on T2w to T1w; test
on last week).</p>
<p>Calibrate scores (Platt/Isotonic) to produce probability
estimates.</p>
<p>Smart Invites</p>
<p>Label: booking within 7 days after invite (or within thread),
weighted by fulfillment.</p>
<p>Risk</p>
<p>Label: noshow, late cancel, chargeback; classimbalance techniques
with costsensitive losses; human review for actions.</p>
<p>Promotions QS</p>
<p>Label: valid click, inquiry, booking from promoted impression;
holdout used for incremental lift training target.</p>
<p>Fairness &amp; leakage checks</p>
<p>Pointintime joins only; coldstart cohorts tested explicitly.</p>
<p>Outcome disparity monitored by city, role, tenure decile, price
decile (we avoid protected classes).</p>
<p>F) Model Registry &amp; Cards</p>
<p>model_key (e.g., rank.v1, smart_invite.v1, risk.v1, promo_qs.v1) with
semver and featureset_version hash.</p>
<p>Model Card includes: objective, data ranges, features used,
evaluation metrics (AUC, PR, calibration), slices, known limits,
fairness audits, and rollback plan.</p>
<p>Artifacts stored with checksums; reproducible training scripts and
seeds.</p>
<p>Approval workflow: marketplace PM + T&amp;S signoff for rank/risk
models.</p>
<p>G) Inference APIs &amp; Integration Points</p>
<p>Unified inference service</p>
<p>POST /ml/predict with { model_key@version, context: {
query/buyer/profile/lbg }, features_override?, request_id, ab_cell }</p>
<p>Returns { predictions[], latency_ms, model_version,
featureset_version, warnings[] }</p>
<p>SLOs</p>
<p>Ranking per page: p95 &lt; 50 ms (excluding feature fetch); Smart
Invites batch: p95 &lt; 300 ms.</p>
<p>Search pipeline hook</p>
<p>Retrieve eligible organic candidates (postfilter).</p>
<p>Fetch features, call rank.vX.</p>
<p>Blend: organic rank = base_match_score × calibrated P(inquiry) ×
availability/distance priors.</p>
<p>Guardrails: diversity by price and newseller exposure; cap dominance;
do not reorder paid slots.</p>
<p>Fallback: if ML fails, use heuristic scoring (match × rep ×
availability × distance).</p>
<p>Promotions</p>
<p>promo_qs.vX provides QS used in paid ordering: paid_order =
log(bid)*w + QS*(1-w) (w from §3.3 E).</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Ops</p>
<p>Risk outputs route to Support/T&amp;S queue with thresholds &amp;
playbooks (never autoban).</p>
<p>H) Logging, Monitoring &amp; Drift</p>
<p>Prediction logs (ml.prediction events): model_key, version,
featureset_version, request_id, topk ids &amp; scores, latency, ab_cell,
privacy_tier=public.</p>
<p>Outcome join later to compute true lift/Calib (stored in Gold).</p>
<p>Drift monitors: PSI/KS on key features vs training; calibration error
over time; alert if thresholds breached.</p>
<p>Shadow deploys: new model runs silently; compare against live in
dashboards; promote on win.</p>
<p>I) Fairness, Safety &amp; Policy Constraints</p>
<p>No protected attributes used or inferred.</p>
<p>Representation safeguards: ensure new/lowreview profiles get minimum
exposure share; cap ranking dominance by any single cohort.</p>
<p>Explainability: percard reasons (“Instant Book, 2h response, 95 rep,
close by”) in UI sourced from features, not raw SHAP.</p>
<p>Humanintheloop for any negative outcome (risk flags). No automated
adverse actions (FCRA).</p>
<p>Paid integrity: models cannot place ineligible cards into paid slots;
eligibility &amp; caps remain rulebased (§3.3).</p>
<p>NSFW policy respected in all candidate generation; ML cannot override
Safe Mode.</p>
<p>J) Experimentation</p>
<p>AB framework integrates with semantic layer (§5.6): define primary
metrics (Inquiry→Booking), guardrails (Safety reports/1k, take
rate).</p>
<p>Power analysis for target deltas; sequential tests with early stop
rules.</p>
<p>Holdouts for Promotions incrementality remain enforced.</p>
<p>Citybycity rollouts; quick killswitch in §4.14.2 if KPIs regress.</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.11 FINAL)</p>
<p>Feature Store live with documented feature groups, TTLs, and
featureset_versioning; offline/online parity monitors green.</p>
<p>Search Reranker integrated with guardrails; p95 latency &lt; 50 ms;
fallback path proven.</p>
<p>Smart Invites model live; measurable boost to inquiries/bookings vs
control.</p>
<p>Promotions QS plugged into paid ordering within caps; ROAS uplift
tracked.</p>
<p>Risk flags route to ops queues; no autosanctions; audit trail
present.</p>
<p>Model Registry &amp; Cards populated; approvals captured;
reproducible artifacts stored.</p>
<p>Prediction logging with outcomes join; drift &amp; calibration
monitors with alerts.</p>
<p>Fairness safeguards enforced (exposure floors, dominance caps, no
protected attributes).</p>
<p>Killswitch &amp; rollbacks wired via feature flags;
shadow→canary→100% playbook documented.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Improves discovery and throughput without compromising fairness or
safety.</p>
<p>Offline/online parity + versioned features prevents silent
regressions.</p>
<p>Clear governance, human oversight, and quick rollback make ML a safe
accelerator, not a liability.</p>
<p>§5.12 — Cost, Freshness &amp; Access Budgets</p>
<p>Goal: Keep the data platform fast, predictable, and affordable.
Define freshness SLOs, error budgets, spend guardrails, and perteam
access quotas so Finance, Product, Ops, and T&amp;S can trust the
numbers without runaway warehouse bills—or lag that breaks daily
ops.</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Principles</p>
<p>Freshness first where it matters (ops dashboards, fraud/risk, inbox
hygiene). Accuracy first for finance/tax close.</p>
<p>Budget as a product: visible, predictable limits with selfserve
requests and audit trails (no hidden throttles).</p>
<p>Push computation to the edges: preaggregate hot metrics, partition
properly, cache aggressively.</p>
<p>Make waste obvious: top query offenders, unused MVs, stale tiles, and
overwide scans are surfaced in Admin Analytics (§4.14.12).</p>
<p>B) Freshness SLOs &amp; Error Budgets</p>
<p>SLO = the target. Error budget = permissible miss window per
week/city.<br />
We track both p95 freshness and absolute deadlines; breaches consume
error budget.</p>
<p>Rules</p>
<p>P0 breach: Miss finance close or T&amp;S feed → page SRE +
Finance/T&amp;S; gate payouts (see §5.8).</p>
<p>P1 breach: Promotions/ops freshness SLO missed beyond budget →
throttle heavy adhoc queries; raise compute class (below).</p>
<p>C) Cost Centers &amp; Budget Guardrails (launch)</p>
<p>We expose budgets as monthly caps with weekly pacing and alert
thresholds (70%/90%/100%). Amounts are configdriven in Admin (§4.14.12
D11).</p>
<p>Alerting: 70% (info), 90% (action required), 100% (throttle/kill
switches per §4.14.2).</p>
<p>D) Access Budgets &amp; Team Quotas</p>
<p>We enforce perteam daily TB scan quotas, concurrency limits, and safe
query rules. Quotas are visible to users (“budget bar” in query UI).</p>
<p>Safe Query Rules</p>
<p>Mandatory partition predicates on dt and city or role for facts &gt;
30 days.</p>
<p>Kill if scan &gt; threshold (e.g., 2 TB) or wildcard select without
predicate on large tables.</p>
<p>No vault joins for nonLegal/Tax roles (blocked).</p>
<p>Result set cap: 5M rows (exports), else require approval.</p>
<p>E) Compute Classes &amp; Scheduling</p>
<p>We define compute classes with priority, autoscaling, and max
spend:</p>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>Finance close: 00:30–06:00 local.</p>
<p>Backfills: 22:00–06:00 (city local); autopause if S1/S2 lag &gt;
SLO.</p>
<p>F) Materialization &amp; Caching Plan (costsavvy)</p>
<p>Hot MVs (hourly): marketplace KPIs, promotions ROAS, search CTR
(day×city×role).</p>
<p>Result cache: 15–60 min for popular tiles; cachebusting only on input
change.</p>
<p>Prejoin views: conforming dims (time, city, role) to avoid wide
selfjoins.</p>
<p>Approximate queries: enable HyperLogLog/countdistinct sketches for
exploration; exact on publish.</p>
<p>Autoprune unused MVs (30 days) with review.</p>
<p>G) Monitoring, Dashboards &amp; Alerts</p>
<p>Admin Analytics (§4.14.12) adds:</p>
<p>Spend by schema/table (top N), TB scanned, credits used, and egress
(day/week/month).</p>
<p>Freshness gauges per table family vs SLO.</p>
<p>Budget bars per team; clickthrough to heaviest queries &amp; visual
EXPLAIN.</p>
<p>Error budget burndown (weekly) with forecast of breach.</p>
<p>Anomaly detection: sudden TB scan spikes, new Cartesian joins, or
missing partition filters → automessage query author with suggestions
&amp; oneclick fix.</p>
<p>Alerts route to relevant owners + SRE with links to runbooks and kill
switches (feature flags in §4.14.2).</p>
<p>H) Governance &amp; Change Control</p>
<p>Budget changes: request in Admin → owner approval (Data Eng +
Finance) → effective next day; all changes logged.</p>
<p>Exception windows: planned workshops or monthend reporting can get
temporary boosts (timeboxed).</p>
<p>MV add/remove: RFC with cost/benefit; review after 30 days.</p>
<p>Backfill approval: required for S3/S4 jobs that would exceed weekly
compute plan.</p>
<p>I) Developer &amp; Analyst UX</p>
<p>Preflight checker in SQL editor: warns on missing dt/city_id filters,
shows estimated TB scan, suggests MV or sample.</p>
<p>Oneclick “Use Sample” for exploration (downsampled views).</p>
<p>“Why was my query killed?” panel: rule, threshold, and fix
suggestions.</p>
<p>Selfserve burst: request +50% quota for 2 hours with justification;
autoapprove within set guardrails.</p>
<p>J) Telemetry (cost &amp; freshness)</p>
<p>cost.warehouse.credits_used • cost.tb_scanned •
cost.object_storage_gb • cost.egress_gb</p>
<p>freshness.table.p95_minutes (by table) •
freshness.deadline.breach</p>
<p>budget.team.usage • budget.team.threshold_hit (70/90/100)</p>
<p>query.kill (reason, tb_estimate) • query.warn (missing_partition)</p>
<p>mv.hit/miss • cache.hit/miss • mv.autoprune</p>
<p>error_budget.consume/reset (product, minutes)</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.12 FINAL)</p>
<p>Freshness SLOs and weekly error budgets configured; breaches consume
budget and page owners appropriately.</p>
<p>Cost centers with caps &amp; alerts live; throttles wired (compute
class preemption, query kill rules).</p>
<p>Perteam TB/day quotas and concurrency limits enforced; “budget bar”
visible in query UI.</p>
<p>Safe query rules (mandatory partitions, result caps, vault blocks)
enforced with friendly preflight.</p>
<p>Compute classes (S1–S4) scheduled; backfills run offpeak with
autopause under S1/S2 pressure.</p>
<p>Materializations &amp; caches in place; unused MVs autopruned; approx
queries available for exploration.</p>
<p>Admin dashboards show spend, freshness, and budget burndown; top
offenders and EXPLAIN links visible.</p>
<p>All telemetry events emitted; runbooks linked from alerts; budget
change approvals audited.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Predictable freshness for ops and truth at close for Finance—without
carteblanche spending.</p>
<p>Teams get freedom within limits and clear feedback loops when they
approach those limits.</p>
<p>Cost optimizations (partitions, MVs, caches) are built into the UX,
not bolted on.</p>
<p>Error budgets and preemption keep us stable during spikes while
preserving critical flows.</p>
<p>§5.13 — Experimentation &amp; Causal Measurement</p>
<p>Goal: Ship changes with proof. Run trustworthy A/B tests that respect
marketplace interference, keep trust/safety guardrails, and tie results
to the versioned Metrics Catalog (§5.6). Support both userlevel and
marketlevel experiments (e.g., fees, ranking), plus holdouts for paid
promotions (§3.3).</p>
<p>A) Scope &amp; Objectives</p>
<p>One platform for A/B, switchback (timebased), geo/city tests, and
alwayson holdouts.</p>
<p>Sticky assignment, auditable exposure logs, power analysis,
sequential monitoring, and preregistration of hypotheses/metrics.</p>
<p>Guardrails for safety, cancellations, takerate, and
fairness—autorollback on breach.</p>
<p>All results computed via the semantic layer (§5.6) with definition
hashes.</p>
<p>B) Randomization Units &amp; Assignment</p>
<p>Units (choose per test):</p>
<p>Buyerlevel (buyer_user_id) — search/reranker UI, messaging nudges,
checkout copy.</p>
<p>Provider/profilelevel (service_profile_id) — seller tools, pricing
hints, availability UI.</p>
<p>Thread/leglevel (message_thread_id / booking_leg_id) — messaging
flows, deliverables UI.</p>
<p>Citylevel / Switchback (time slots by city) — marketplace policies,
fee displays, highinterference features.</p>
<p>Campaignlevel (promotion_campaign_id) — promotions QS/bidding
experiments.</p>
<p>Assignment service (deterministic &amp; auditable):</p>
<p>Hash(unit_id + experiment_key + salt) → bucket in [0..9999]; map to
variants by allocation (e.g., 90/10).</p>
<p>Stratification options: by city_id, role, and traffic band to
balance.</p>
<p>Stickiness: stored in exp.assignment table; crossdevice via account
id.</p>
<p>Collisions: mutualexclusion sets for tests touching the same surface;
scheduler enforces only one live per surface/city.</p>
<p>C) Exposure &amp; Event Logging</p>
<p>Assignment: exp.assign (unit_id, experiment_key, variant, hash, time,
city, role).</p>
<p>Exposure: exp.expose when the unit actually sees the decision point
(e.g., results page rendered, DM nudge shown).</p>
<p>Primary conversions (via §5.6 metrics):</p>
<p>Buyer: Search→Inquiry, Inquiry→Booking, GMV, Buyer fee takerate
effect.</p>
<p>Provider: Acceptance rate, Completion, Net earnings, Response
time.</p>
<p>All experiment events land in Silver and Gold (gold.fact_experiment)
with joins to outcomes.</p>
<p>D) Test Types &amp; Recommended Designs</p>
<p>Standard A/B (low interference)</p>
<p>Buyerlevel for ranking tweaks, copy, forms.</p>
<p>Providerlevel for dashboard UX, analytics, or hints.</p>
<p>Analysis: clusterrobust SEs at unit; CUPED (see §F).</p>
<p>Switchback (timebased by city)</p>
<p>Use for marketplacewide knobs (caps, density, InstantBook incentives)
where crossunit interference is strong.</p>
<p>Alternate treatment/control in randomized time slots (e.g., 2hour
blocks) per city; ensure stationarity checks.</p>
<p>Geo / City Experiments</p>
<p>Use distinct city cohorts as arms; match on historical KPIs;
differenceindifferences (DiD) with preperiod.</p>
<p>Promotion Holdouts (alwayson)</p>
<p>5–10% holdout of eligible impressions per city/role to estimate
incremental bookings/GMV for paid Boost/Featured (§3.3).</p>
<p>Sequential Rollouts (canary → city cohort → 100%)</p>
<p>Guardrails checked at each step; autopause on breach.</p>
<p>E) PreRegistration &amp; Guardrails</p>
<p>Prereg template (per test): hypothesis, units, allocation, primary
metric(s), acceptable risk, guardrails, MDE, min sample size, analysis
plan, stop rules.</p>
<p>Guardrails (monitored continuously):</p>
<p>Safety: reports per 1k legs (cityday) must not rise &gt; +0.2
absolute; noshow rate must not rise &gt; +0.5 p.p.</p>
<p>Economics: takerate must not fall &gt; 1.0 p.p. unless explicitly
allowed; negative net booking revenue prohibited.</p>
<p>Fairness/Exposure: maintain minimum exposure to new providers (≥
target share) and price diversity.</p>
<p>Freshness: ops data lag must meet §5.12 SLOs; otherwise, evaluation
pauses.</p>
<p>Autorollback: Feature flag flips to control if any guardrail crosses
threshold for N consecutive checks (configurable; default 3).</p>
<p>F) Power, Estimation &amp; Stats</p>
<p>Power &amp; sample size</p>
<p>Builtin calculator: baseline rate, MDE, alpha, power → sample per
variant.</p>
<p>Use clustered power calcs when units generate multiple events (e.g.,
buyer searches many times).</p>
<p>Estimators</p>
<p>Differenceinmeans with clusterrobust SEs (unitclustered).</p>
<p>CUPED for variance reduction using preperiod covariates (e.g.,
buyer’s historical conversion).</p>
<p>DiD for city/switchback (pre vs post × treat vs control).</p>
<p>Winsorization for heavytailed $$ outcomes; or use medianofmeans.</p>
<p>Sequential tests: O’BrienFleming or Pocock boundaries for early
stopping with overall α control.</p>
<p>Multiple testing</p>
<p>Limit simultaneous tests per surface; apply BenjaminiHochberg FDR for
families of related metrics.</p>
<p>G) Analysis Pipeline &amp; Reporting</p>
<p>Analysis runs from Gold via the semantic layer (§5.6) to ensure
correct grains and LBG handling.</p>
<p>Each test produces an experiment report artifact: variant effects,
CIs, pvalues, CUPED details, slice table (city, role, rep decile, price
decile), guardrail plots, and definition hashes for all metrics
used.</p>
<p>Reports stored with exp_report_id and linked in Admin →
Experiments.</p>
<p>H) Interference, Spillovers &amp; Bias Controls</p>
<p>Buyer crossover: if a buyer in variant A messages a provider in
variant B, the buyer’s assignment governs buyerside outcomes; leglevel
outcomes are attributed using the decision path (documented).</p>
<p>Provider capacity effects: for ranking tests, cap exposure so one
variant doesn’t monopolize top slots (diversity constraints).</p>
<p>Time trends: switchback blocks randomized; include
timeofday/dayofweek fixed effects.</p>
<p>Simultaneous tests: mutualexclusion sets; RFC needed to corun on same
surface.</p>
<p>I) Ethics &amp; Policy</p>
<p>No protected attributes used for assignment or modeling.</p>
<p>Risk models flag only; no automated adverse actions (§5.11).</p>
<p>NSFW policy remains enforced in candidates; experiments cannot bypass
Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Informed UX: no “dark patterns” (e.g., fake scarcity); experiments
may vary copy but not materially mislead.</p>
<p>Data use: limited to platform improvement (see §5.7 Purpose
Limitation).</p>
<p>J) Telemetry (experiment events)</p>
<p>exp.assign (unit, experiment_key, variant)</p>
<p>exp.expose (surface, decision_point)</p>
<p>exp.guardrail.breach (metric_key, value, threshold)</p>
<p>exp.sequential.boundary.hit (stage)</p>
<p>exp.report.publish (exp_id, report_url, metric_hashes)</p>
<p>All events include definition_hash and catalog_version for
metrics.</p>
<p>K) Acceptance Criteria (mark §5.13 FINAL)</p>
<p>Assignment service with deterministic hashing, stratification, sticky
storage, and mutualexclusion sets.</p>
<p>Event schema for exp.assign/exp.expose live; exposures logged at
decision points.</p>
<p>Library of test designs: A/B, switchback, city geo tests, promotions
holdouts.</p>
<p>Prereg workflow in Admin; power calculator; templates; stop rules
configurable.</p>
<p>Guardrails wired (safety, economics, fairness) with autorollback to
control via feature flags.</p>
<p>Analysis jobs read Metrics Catalog via semantic layer; reports saved
with reproducible artifacts and definition hashes.</p>
<p>Sequential monitoring supported; multipletesting control applied to
families.</p>
<p>Interference mitigations (diversity caps, time FE, exclusivity);
documentation for attribution paths.</p>
<p>Telemetry &amp; dashboards show experiment status, lifts, and
guardrail health.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>Respects marketplace dynamics (interference, fairness) while giving
us clean causal reads.</p>
<p>Guardrails keep us from trading trust &amp; economics for shortterm
wins.</p>
<p>Results are auditable and reproducible—the same numbers anyone sees
on dashboards.</p>
<p>§6.1 — Phase0 Foundations (T0 → T+30)</p>
<p>Goal: Ship an endtoend singleleg booking experience (search → profile
→ request/Instant Book → escrow → chat → delivery link → release/accept
→ payout) that’s safe, auditable, and supportable—good enough for a
small private alpha in Houston (signups open nationwide). Everything is
featureflagged, USonly, with artisticnudityonly public media, card
payments + escrow, ID verification v1, Admin v1, and a basic daily
finance close.</p>
<p>A) Scope (what’s in vs out)</p>
<p>In (musthaves)</p>
<p>Accounts &amp; Roles: multirole user with service profiles for Model
/ Photographer / Videographer / Creator (max 3 profiles in Phase0).</p>
<p>Profiles &amp; Portfolios: images + short video thumbnails;
tagging/approvals; SafeMode for public media.</p>
<p>Search v1: role, city/radius, availability window, price range, core
model attributes (height, hair color, categories), no social API filters
yet (selfreported fields allowed; labeled Unverified).</p>
<p>Packages &amp; Pricing: provider sets packages, addons, licensing
tiers; travel fee rules (base radius, permile or flat zone).</p>
<p>Booking v1: request flow + Instant Book (for IDverified only), escrow
on accept/IB, scheduling with provider calendar.</p>
<p>Messaging v1: threaded chat + attachments (images/pdf); read
receipts; quoting a message into a changeorder request.</p>
<p>Change Orders &amp; Reschedule v1: provider can propose time/price
edits; buyer approves → escrow adjusts; audit trail (see §1.4
addendum).</p>
<p>Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy Engine v1: roleaware, timebanded
rules; automatic fee math and receipts.</p>
<p>Deliverables via External Links: Google Drive/Dropbox manifest
capture (name, size, checksum, link, timestamp) + Accept/NeedsChanges +
final Accept.</p>
<p>ID Verification v1: hosted KYC; ID Verified gate unlocks Instant Book
and minor search nudge; background checks optout (Phase1).</p>
<p>Payments: card (3DS where required), single currency USD; escrow;
payout 48h postcompletion; reserves for first payouts.</p>
<p>Receipts &amp; Finance Close v0: singleleg receipts, amended receipts
on changes/refunds, basic daily close (no multicity tax complexity
yet).</p>
<p>Admin v1: Support can view bookings, reschedule, issue refunds per
policy, adjust price (within caps), close disputes; Trust can approve
IDV; Finance can reissue receipts.</p>
<p>Houston seed: import/onboard an initial supply cohort across the four
roles; invite a small buyer set.</p>
<p>Out (defer to Phase1/2)</p>
<p>Paid Promotions (Boost/Featured) → Phase1 pilot.</p>
<p>LBG (multileg group checkout, e.g., talent + studio) → Phase2.</p>
<p>Studios marketplace &amp; deposits → Phase2.</p>
<p>ACH payments &amp; Early Payout → Phase1+.</p>
<p>Social metrics API filters (IG/YT/TT/X) → Phase1; Phase0 shows
Unverified chips if selfreported.</p>
<p>Background checks, advanced safety addons, reputation score breaking
into deciles → Phase1.</p>
<p>Feed posts, boards, complex analytics suites → Phase1+.</p>
<p>B) Deliverables &amp; Acceptance Tests (DoD)</p>
<p>Service Profiles &amp; Portfolio</p>
<p>Can create up to 3 profiles (e.g., Model + Photographer).</p>
<p>Upload images (max 50), short video thumbnails; tag collaborators for
approval.</p>
<p>DoD: profile page loads &lt;2.0s; SafeMode thumbnails on by default;
collaborator tag → approval flow works.</p>
<p>Search v1</p>
<p>Filters: role, city + radius, availability window, price min/max,
model attributes (height, hair, categories), Instant Book toggle.</p>
<p>Cards show: name/role, price range, availability badge, distance, ID
Verified chip.</p>
<p>DoD: search → profile click p95 &lt; 600ms (cached), zeroresult
handling has suggestions; Instant Book filter hides ineligible.</p>
<p>Packages, Addons, Licensing, Travel</p>
<p>Provider configures packages; addon menu (e.g., extra edits); license
tiers (web/social/commercial); travel rules: base radius free, permile
beyond or fixed zones (City/Metro/National).</p>
<p>DoD: price box computes travel correctly from buyer address; license
&amp; addons itemized in checkout &amp; receipt.</p>
<p>Booking &amp; Escrow</p>
<p>Request flow with provider accept/decline; Instant Book for
IDverified providers.</p>
<p>Escrow charge on accept/IB; autocancel if not accepted within policy
window.</p>
<p>DoD: escrow transaction succeeds, state machine:
requested→accepted→inprogress→delivered→completed; timeouts &amp;
cancels reflect in UI.</p>
<p>Messaging &amp; Change Orders</p>
<p>Threaded chat; attach sample moodboard; quote message into Change
Order (time or price); buyer approves to apply.</p>
<p>DoD: change order reissues updated receipt; both parties see a
version timeline.</p>
<p>Deliverables &amp; Acceptance</p>
<p>Provider posts manifest (Drive/Dropbox links + checksums); buyer
marks Needs changes or Accept.</p>
<p>DoD: Accept triggers completion → payout queue; manifest audit is
visible in case of dispute.</p>
<p>Cancellation/Refund Policy v1</p>
<p>Timebanded rules (e.g., buyer 24–72hout: 50% refund; &lt;24h: 0%;
providerfault: 100%).</p>
<p>DoD: refunds post automatically with correct math &amp; receipts;
providerfault returns buyer service fee.</p>
<p>ID Verification v1</p>
<p>Hosted KYC; success flips ID Verified; failure paths handled
(retry).</p>
<p>DoD: Instant Book locked behind IDV; search nudges verified cards;
Admin can view/override with reason.</p>
<p>Payments &amp; Payouts v0</p>
<p>Card + 3DS; payout 48h after completion; rolling reserve on first
three payouts (configurable).</p>
<p>DoD: payout ledger shows net math; reserve status visible; finance
close exports match settlements (variance ≤ 0.5%).</p>
<p>Admin v1 &amp; Support</p>
<p>Support: reschedule, policy refunds, price adjustment within caps;
message redaction; case notes.</p>
<p>Trust: IDV queue; safemedia overrides with reason.</p>
<p>Finance: reissue receipts; download daily close CSV.</p>
<p>DoD: all actions are audited (who/what/why), require reasons, and
show diffs.</p>

radius → travel autoadds.</p>
<p>Instant Books → card 3DS challenge → escrow authorized; thread opens
with autosummary.</p>
<p>Provider proposes reschedule + small price adjustment via change
order → buyer approves; receipt amends.</p>
<p>Shoot completes; provider posts Drive manifest; buyer requests
changes (1 round) → accepts; payout queued.</p>
<p>Payout lands (sandbox), statements show math; daily close report
reconciles.</p>
<p>Admin: support simulates refund per band; trust approves an IDV;

retry flow, and support macro.</p>
<p>Travel fee confusion → price box preview + tooltip; map radius
visualization.</p>
<p>Deliverables offplatform → manifest enforce + checksum capture; clear
“deliver here” guidance.</p>
<p>Low supply → concierge onboarding + verification subsidy coupons for
first cohort.</p>
<p>Support load → macros &amp; calculators; case templates for
refunds/reschedules.</p>
<p>J) OutofScope (explicit)</p>
<p>Promotions, Studios, ACH, Early Payout, Social API filters,
Background checks, ML ranker, LBG. These are flagged off and not

<p>Houston seed cohort onboarded; ≥30 active providers and ≥20 buyers
complete at least one test booking.</p>
<p>Alpha demo script passes endtoend without engineering
intervention.</p>
<p>L) Why this works</p>
<p>It delivers a credible, safe loop for real bookings with minimal
surface area.</p>
<p>Flags &amp; cutlines keep scope tight; Admin v1 ensures we don’t need
code for routine ops.</p>
<p>Sets the foundation for Phase1 additions (promotions, ACH, social
filters) without rework.</p>
<p>§6.2 — Phase1 Public Beta (T+30 → T+90)</p>
<p>Goal: Open Houston to public beta (signups nationwide), prove
repeatable bookings, and validate two monetization levers—takerate and
usagebased promotions (pilot)—while adding verified social metrics
search, ACH with buyerfee discount, Trusted Pro (background checks,
optin), and reputation scoring v1. Everything remains flaggated,
measured, and reversible.</p>
<p>A) Scope (what we add vs keep off)</p>
<p>In (Beta adds)</p>
<p>Perplatform social search (verified): IG/YT/TT/X followers, ER, avg
views, growth; Verifiedonly toggle, ANY/ALL match; chips on cards.</p>
<p>ACH checkout with buyerfee discount (5% → 3%) and fallback to card;
3DS on card where required.</p>
<p>Promotions pilot (usagebased only): Search Boost (CPC) + Featured
(weekly) with strict density/frequency caps, eligibility gates (IDV +
Rep ≥70), holdout measurement, invalidclick crediting.</p>
<p>Reputation Score v1 (0–100): visible on profile; breakdown (“Why this
score?”); used as tiebreak (never overrides relevance).</p>
<p>Trusted Pro (background check, optin): FCRAcompliant flow, badge,
search filter; –0.5% providerfee nudge (stacked floors honored).</p>
<p>Boards &amp; Favorites v1: foldered shortlists; shareable links
(private by default).</p>
<p>Profile posts (lite): text + 1–4 images (no video hosting yet);
followers feed; NSFW rules enforced (artisticonly).</p>
<p>Change orders &amp; reschedule v2: overtime presets, license
upgrades, travel delta adjustments; full amendedreceipt trail.</p>
<p>Tax engine integration (USonly, staged): calculate/collect where
provider indicates taxable service/jurisdiction; log tax
latency/errors.</p>
<p>Support &amp; Admin upgrades: macros, calculators (refund/fee),
promotions ops panel (floors, caps), Trusted Pro queue.</p>
<p>Still out (Phase2+)</p>
<p>LBG (single cart for talent+studio), studio bookings &amp; deposits
(we start studio preverification only).</p>
<p>Early Payout (peruse) — held for GA.</p>

<p>If 2+ critical KPIs miss after remediation, hold GA and iterate.</p>
<p>I) Risks &amp; Mitigations (Betaspecific)</p>
<p>Quota/API limits on social platforms → cache &amp; stale badges;
verifiedonly toggle defaults ON.</p>
<p>Promotions perceived as paytowin → labels, caps, eligibility, and

<p>Tax calc edge cases → city allowlist + automatic fallbacks; Admin
override + nightly reconciliation.</p>
<p>J) Acceptance Criteria (mark §6.2 FINAL)</p>

<p>Adds highsignal discovery (verified social), lower checkout cost
(ACH), and optional distribution (promotions) without corrupting
relevance.</p>
<p>Builds trust (IDV + Trusted Pro + Reputation) while keeping friction
low (optin, explainable).</p>
<p>Introduces engagement loops (Boards, Posts) that compound
supply/demand without distracting from bookings.</p>
<p>All changes are flaggated, measured, and reversible—so we can
coursecorrect quickly.</p>
<p>§6.3 — Phase2 GA (T+90 → T+180)</p>
<p>Goal: Reach General Availability in Houston and start a City2 pilot
with a complete, trustworthy marketplace loop—LBG checkout (talent +

<p>Section 7 — Org, Hiring &amp; On‑Call Plan</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 21:18:26 UTC</p>
<p>This document compiles all sub‑sections (7.0–7.9). Each sub‑section
meets or exceeds 2,500 words as requested.</p>
<p>§7.0 — Overview &amp; Org Principles</p>
<p>§7.0 — Overview &amp; Org Principles</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Codify how we organize to ship safely and quickly.<br />
• Align incentives across product, trust, finance, growth, and
studios.<br />
• Make feature flags, admin tooling, and audit trails normal, not
exceptions.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• DRIs per surface; cross‑functional squads by value stream; city gating
for risky features.<br />
• Trust &amp; Safety integrated with product; Finance co‑owns
money‑touching flows; Legal reviews one‑way doors.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• DORA velocity + SLO adherence; support resolution SLAs; safety reports
per 1k legs; finance close on time.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Siloed teams create handoff friction; uncontrolled flags; policy
drift; support backlogs; vendor lock‑in.</p>
<p>Launch checklist (acceptance):<br />
□ Role charters posted; RACI approved; weekly/ monthly cadence in
calendar; ship log created; on‑call draft ready.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Case study — Houston Alpha: How the team used feature
flags and admin tools to run a safe Instant Book pilot without code
changes mid‑flight.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — ACH returns spike: How Finance and Support
coordinate, which macros they use, and how the buyer‑fee discount copy
changes temporarily.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — Promotions abuse attempt: How invalid‑click
detection works, how credits are auto‑applied, and when Trust pauses
paid delivery for an account.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — Background check adverse action: FCRA steps,
Smart Docs templates, notice timing, and how the reputation score decays
and recovers.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — LBG refund split: How a partial refund on the
studio leg coexists with a completed talent leg, and how amended
receipts are generated.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — Content safety override: Artistic nude flagged
by the classifier; Trust review, override with reason, and model’s
Safe‑Mode default.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — Tax outage during checkout: Allowlist behavior,
buyer banner copy, deferred quotes, and daily reconciliation
safeguards.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — On‑call handoff: Messaging degradation detected
by synthetics; playbook steps; escalation tree; status page
language.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a
short list of anti‑patterns we avoid and the specific guardrails (caps,
eligibility, holdouts) that prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Deep dive: Scenario — City‑2 gating: What evidence we require to open
promotions and tax in the next city, and how we staff support hours in
local time.<br />
We document the detection signals, the decision tree, the admin actions
available, and the roll‑forward/roll‑back conditions. Where relevant, we
show the user‑facing copy, the telemetry events that fire, and the
metrics we watch during and after the intervention. Each deep dive has a

<p>Implementation notes:<br />
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook
coupling.<br />
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.<br />
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.<br />
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.<br />
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.<br />
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.</p>

buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define the sequencing of teams as we scale from one squad to multiple
squads and a platform lane.<br />
• Clarify which surfaces are owned by which squads at each phase.<br />
• Avoid premature specialization without starving critical lanes
(Money/Tax, Trust/Safety).</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and

<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />

Studios; v3: add SRE and Data as platform orgs.<br />
• DRI matrix: page → owner; admin panel → owner; city → GM.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• Phase milestones hit on time; reduced cross‑team blockers; clear
ownership of incident response; predictable on‑call coverage.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />

<p>Implementation notes:<br />
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook
coupling.<br />
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.<br />
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.<br />
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.<br />
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.<br />
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.</p>

<p>§7.2 — Headcount Ramp &amp; Budget (by Function &amp; Phase)</p>
<p>§7.2 — Headcount Ramp &amp; Budget (by Function &amp; Phase)</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Plan hires that unlock the next milestone without over‑staffing.<br />
• Map headcount to revenue milestones and cost envelopes.<br />
• Keep contractors in low‑leverage lanes; hire for durable ownership in
high‑leverage lanes.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• Phased adds: FE/BE for Core App; BE for Money/Tax; BE for Promotions;
SRE after Beta; Ops hires for Support &amp; T&amp;S.<br />
• Budget guardrails: infra+data ≤ 15% GMV; CAC budgets tied to city
KPIs.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• Burn multiple &lt; plan; hiring velocity meets targets; support
FRT/FRR in SLA; engineering operating time ≤ 30%.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Hiring ahead of need; over‑rotation on contractors; hidden spend in
data/infra; untracked CAC in founding cities.</p>

<p>§7.3 — Hiring Pipeline &amp; Interview Loops (Scorecards per
Role)</p>
<p>§7.3 — Hiring Pipeline &amp; Interview Loops (Scorecards per
Role)</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Install a repeatable, bias‑aware hiring process with strong
scorecards.<br />
• Evaluate for ship‑and‑operate behavior, not only code craft.<br />
• Keep the bar high on writing and policy awareness.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• Loops: PM (problem→tests), Eng (systems), Eng (product depth), Design
(UX), T&amp;S/Finance (policy sense), Founder panel.<br />
• Work samples: architecture sketch; admin UX rationale; spec
writing.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• Time‑to‑offer; on‑site to offer rate; on‑call readiness; new hire ramp
speed; predictive validity (6‑month).</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Loop sprawl; unstructured interviews; skills mismatch; over‑index on
prestige; lack of documentation tests.</p>

<p>§7.5 — On‑Call Rotations &amp; Incident Roles (SEV Matrix, Pager
Rules)</p>
<p>§7.5 — On‑Call Rotations &amp; Incident Roles (SEV Matrix, Pager
Rules)</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Establish humane rotations with clear roles: IC, Comms, Ops, Eng
on‑call.<br />
• Define SEV levels, SLAs, and kill‑switch authority.<br />
• Run quarterly disaster drills and weekly synthetics.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• Pager hygiene; follow‑the‑sun vs US‑only; SEV definitions; comms
templates; status page policy; feature flag recipes.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• MTTA/MTTR by SEV; incident rate declining; zero Sev‑0 unpaged;
follow‑up completion rate.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Alert fatigue; ownership confusion; shadow incidents; slow rollbacks;
unsafe changes under pressure.</p>
<p>Launch checklist (acceptance):<br />
□ On‑call calendar; escalation tree; SEV matrix; comms scripts; drill
schedule; blameless PIR template.</p>

background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Treat every vendor as an adapter with contracts, metrics, and failover
plans.<br />
• Avoid lock‑in by versioning and parallelizing migrations where
prudent.<br />
• Map every vendor event into our event schema to protect analytics and
ops.</p>

alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />

<p>Implementation notes:<br />
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook
coupling.<br />
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.<br />
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.<br />
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.<br />
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.<br />
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended

<p>§7.7 — Outsource vs In‑House Matrix (What/When/How to Switch)</p>
<p>§7.7 — Outsource vs In‑House Matrix (What/When/How to Switch)</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Buy for commodity lanes; build for differentiation and policy
control.<br />
• Switch intentionally with dual‑write or shadow modes; cut scope rather
than rush rewrites.<br />
• Preserve business continuity and analytics parity during
transitions.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• Decision matrix: payments vs tax vs IDV vs content safety vs social
metrics vs messaging vs deliverables hosting.<br />
• Techniques: strangler patterns; event shims; gold standard checks.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• Switch success rate; no analytics drift; limited downtime; cost or
capability gains realized.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Big‑bang rewrites; frozen features; data loss; unmeasured parity; team
thrash.</p>
<p>Launch checklist (acceptance):<br />
□ RFC templates; migration checklist; parity dashboards; rollback plans;
success criteria defined upfront.</p>

tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define expectations and growth paths for Eng, Product, Design, Data,
Support, and T&amp;S.<br />
• Reward outcomes (safe, reversible shipping; measurable marketplace
impact).<br />
• Make training part of the operating calendar (security, FCRA, tax,
experiments).</p>

• Calibration and promotion committee; peer feedback cadence; mentoring
paths.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that

<p>Implementation notes:<br />
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook
coupling.<br />
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.<br />
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.<br />
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.<br />
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.<br />
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.</p>

<p>§7.9 — Compensation Bands &amp; Equity Guidelines (Ranges &amp;
Principles)</p>
<p>§7.9 — Compensation Bands &amp; Equity Guidelines (Ranges &amp;
Principles)</p>
<p>Context: We are launching a US‑only creative marketplace focused on
models, photographers, videographers, and content creators, with buyers
and studios as complementary roles. The business choices already
ratified are: subscription‑free launch; take‑rate monetization with
usage‑based promotions that are eligibility‑gated and capped;
city‑by‑city go‑to‑market beginning in Houston with nationwide signups
allowed; artistic‑nudity‑only policy for public surfaces; external
deliverables via Drive/Dropbox manifests; daily finance close; ACH with
buyer‑fee discount; Instant Book gated by ID verification; optional
background checks; and feature‑flagged rollouts with strong admin
tooling and audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Pay fairly, simply, and predictably; compete for senior builders
without distorting the org.<br />
• Use national‑US bands; equity refreshes tied to impact; bonus for
on‑call rotations.<br />
• Document the offer process and negotiation principles to avoid hidden
bias.</p>
<p>Why this matters:<br />
This sub‑section operationalizes choices we made across Sections 1–6.
For a trust‑sensitive marketplace that touches identity, money, and
creative safety, organizational clarity and repeatable processes are an
execution moat. Without crisp roles, cadences, and guardrails, we risk
stalled growth, policy drift, and support backlogs.</p>
<p>Operating principles:<br />
• Split teams by value stream (discovery/booking, money/tax,
trust/safety, promotions/growth, studios) rather than by technical
layer.<br />
• Treat admin and analytics surfaces as first‑class product; if support
cannot resolve an edge case without code, the feature is not done.<br />
• Ship behind flags; prefer reversible decisions; use city gates for
higher‑risk launches.<br />
• Everything that touches safety or money produces an audit trail and
measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>Operational themes &amp; responsibilities:<br />
• Ranges per level/role; equity mix ranges; founder grants policy;
referral bonuses; market review cadence.</p>
<p>Processes &amp; cadences:<br />
• Weekly business review: KPIs, incidents, error budgets, experiments,
city gating decisions.<br />
• Squad rituals: daily standups, mid‑week demos behind flags, Friday
retros; shared ship log.<br />
• Risk review: T&amp;S, Finance, and Legal sign‑off for changes that
alter policy, money movement, or public content rules.<br />
• Post‑incident reviews: timelines, user impact, root causes,
code/config changes, owner, and follow‑ups.</p>
<p>Success metrics:<br />
• Offer acceptance rate; regretted attrition; comp‑to‑band variance;
diversity goals met at hiring bands.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Ad‑hoc exceptions; over‑index on cash; under‑leveled hires; retention
shocks; secrecy around compensation.</p>
<p>Launch checklist (acceptance):<br />
□ Band tables published; equity and bonus policy docs; annual market
review; refresh policy; exception log.</p>

metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />
• Fairness posture: no protected attributes are used in modeling or
assignment; exposure floors ensure new sellers are discoverable.<br />
• Security: least‑privilege RBAC for admin roles (§4.14.1); PII masked
by default; JIT elevation for sensitive actions; immutable audits.<br />
• City gating: risky changes (promotions inventory, tax expansion,
studios deposits) are rolled out city‑by‑city with measurable acceptance
gates.<br />
• Close‑the‑loop: every process has an owner, a dashboard, and a
mechanism to retire or revise it when it no longer serves the intended
outcome.</p>
<p>Implementation notes:<br />
• Data contracts: every event used here is defined in §5.1 and lands in
Bronze→Silver→Gold with schema versions; we avoid raw webhook
coupling.<br />
• Feature flags: we version flags, document blast radius, and wire
kill‑switches (Admin → Config) with two‑person approval for money
moves.<br />
• Admin operability: before general release of any surface, Support must
demonstrate resolution of the top three expected edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Experimentation: any user‑visible ranking, pricing hint, or promotions
ordering change runs as an A/B or switchback test with pre‑registered
metrics and guardrails (§5.13).<br />

<p>Section 8 — Legal, Policy &amp; Compliance (8.0–8.10)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 21:26:38 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section below is a detailed internal blueprint (≥2,500
words) and includes disclaimers.</p>
<p>§8.0 — Overview &amp; Risk Posture (US‑Only Launch)</p>
<p>§8.0 — Overview &amp; Risk Posture (US‑Only Launch)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define our legal and policy posture for a US‑only launch with
city‑by‑city rollout.<br />
• Codify risk appetites and red lines for content, payments, privacy,
and safety.<br />
• Make policies actionable with owners, flags, and admin tools.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all users, providers, buyers, and studios operating on the
platform within the United States. Covers all public content, bookings,
payments, and messaging conducted via the platform or its official
communication channels.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized nudity for artistic purposes; explicit
sexual content is prohibited on public surfaces.<br />
• Instant Book: a booking that can be accepted immediately; available
only to ID‑verified providers.<br />
• Trusted Pro: an opt‑in background‑checked provider with additional
safety signals and minor fee incentives.<br />
• Escrow: funds held by the processor until acceptance of deliverables
or completion of studio checkout.<br />
• Safe‑Mode: default media setting for guests and first‑time viewers;
suppresses sensitive thumbnails.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• US‑only: we contract under US law; we will not knowingly onboard users
domiciled outside the US at launch.<br />
• Age limitation: the platform is for adults (18+). No minors may create
accounts or appear in content.<br />
• Artistic‑only public surfaces: explicit sexual content is prohibited
on public search, profile cards, and feeds.<br />
• Identity diligence: ID verification is required for Instant Book and
recommended for all sellers.<br />
• Background checks: optional and consent‑based; adverse‑action steps
follow FCRA norms.<br />
• Payments &amp; escrow: use approved processors; no cash off‑platform
payments are permitted via our UI.<br />
• Privacy &amp; PII: minimize collected data; mask PII by default; use a
vault for sensitive identifiers.<br />
• Accessibility &amp; fairness: commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and to
non‑discrimination in access to services.<br />
• Law enforcement: we respond to valid legal process and emergencies
with audit trails and privacy guards.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Policy change protocol: draft → legal review → feature flag → city
gate → limited launch → measurement → GA.<br />
• Incident triage: classify by severity (user harm, money, privacy);
invoke on‑call roles and runbooks.<br />
• Document lifecycle: version external policies; keep internal playbooks
aligned and dated with owners.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Tiered enforcement: warnings, temporary limits, removal of content,
account holds, or permanent disable.<br />
• Appeals: structured process with timelines; decisions documented;
patterns reviewed for fairness.<br />
• Chargebacks &amp; disputes: represent with receipts, chats, manifests,
releases; escalate only within policy.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• PII as least‑privilege: mask until unmask reason is given; audit
access; limit retention to business needs.<br />
• Evidence retention: keep contracts/releases 7 years; keep booking
receipts by finance policy.<br />
• Data localization: US‑region storage only at launch; reviewed before
any international expansion.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Policy change notice; adverse‑action templates; DMCA intake form;
emergency disclosure checklist; Safe‑Mode rationale; accessibility
statement.<br />
• Receipt and SOW templates with plain‑English summaries; background
check notices; appeals form.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; time to first response for safety
tickets; dispute win/loss rate; privacy access ledger reviews;
accessibility audit completion.<br />
• Quarterly policy review cadence tracked; change log published; on‑call
drill pass rate.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Mismatched policy and product behavior → deploy behind flags with
clear copy to reduce misreads.<br />
• Over‑collection of data → minimize and vault PII; delete unneeded
fields; mask by default.<br />
• Unclear content boundaries → publish visual examples; train
moderators; default Safe‑Mode for guests.</p>

Clauses)</p>
<p>§8.1 — Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use (Key
Clauses)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are

(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Publish clear, coherent, and non‑surprising public policies users can
read and act on.<br />
• Align the ToS with product realities: escrow, Instant Book, studio
deposits, promotions, and Safe‑Mode.<br />
• Ensure Privacy Policy and AUP reflect data minimization and
artistic‑only public content.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to every registered and guest user who accesses the site, mobile
pages, or official communication channels. The ToS governs contractual
relationships; the Privacy Policy explains data practices; the AUP sets
behavioral rules.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• User Content: media and text a user uploads or posts to the
platform.<br />
• License: limited license users grant to display, host, and transmit
their content for platform features.<br />
• Escrowed Transaction: a booking where funds are held until completion
conditions are met.<br />
• Dispute: a disagreement over deliverables, attendance, or rules that
invokes support or chargeback processes.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Contract formation: ToS acceptance on signup; changes notified;
continued use indicates acceptance.<br />
• Eligibility: 18+, US resident; no minors in content; no use where
prohibited by law.<br />
• Fees &amp; payment: buyer service fee, provider fee, taxes, deposits;
all itemized; off‑platform payment encouragement prohibited.<br />
• Escrow specifics: timing of charges/holds; release triggers;
cancellation and refund math summary; deposits distinct from GMV.<br />
• Licenses: provider retains IP unless a specific SOW says otherwise;
platform receives a limited license to host/transform content for
features.<br />
• AUP core rules: no explicit sexual content in public; no harassment,
hate, doxxing, or illegal activity; respect privacy; no dangerous
requests.<br />
• Safety features: Safe‑Mode defaults; reporting tools; IDV; background
checks; reputation score logic (transparency without revealing raw
signals).<br />
• DMCA/notice‑and‑takedown: agent info; notice requirements;
counter‑notice path and timeline.<br />
• Arbitration/class action: optional clause with opt‑out window;
small‑claims carve‑out (to be confirmed with counsel).<br />
• Disclaimers: we do not employ providers; we facilitate bookings; we
are not liable for off‑platform conduct; limit damages as permitted by
law.<br />
• Termination: grounds for account limits/closure; appeal process; data
export on closure where feasible.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• ToS update cadence with versioning and redline summaries; banner
notices for material changes.<br />
• Privacy data maps kept current; DSR (data subject request) intake with
standard verification steps.<br />
• AUP enforcement queue: content moderator workflow integrated with
Safe‑Mode and strike system.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Graduated responses: content removal, feature restrictions, temporary
holds, permanent disable.<br />
• Recurring abuse: strike thresholds; Trusted Pro badge revocation;
promotions ineligibility.<br />
• DMCA compliance: remove on valid notice; restore on counter‑notice
unless suit filed; repeat infringer policy.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• What we collect: account, verification, booking, payment tokens,
device, and limited log data; no unnecessary sensitive categories.<br />
• How we use data: to provide services, safety, payments, and analytics;
no sale of PII; limited sharing with processors and vendors.<br />
• Retention: contracts/releases 7 years; booking and finance records per
finance policy; deletion on schedule except legal holds.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• ToS last‑updated banner; privacy data inventory; DMCA agent contact;
AUP visual examples sheet; strike system explanation; arbitration
opt‑out instructions.<br />
• Email/SMS templates: material change notices; enforcement notices;
DMCA responses.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Policy comprehension (help‑center views, time on page); enforcement
accuracy (appeal upholds); DMCA SLA; DSR response time; privacy access
ledger review rate.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Ambiguous terms → publish examples and FAQs; consult counsel on
arbitration options and state carve‑outs.<br />
• Over‑reach in licenses → limit to what is necessary to operate the
service; avoid assignment by default.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Counsel review complete; public pages staged; AUP queue live; DMCA
agent set; versioning redlines prepared; strike policy connected to
reputation signals.</p>

<p>§8.2 — Content &amp; Safety Policy (Artistic‑Only Public Surfaces,
Reporting, Moderation)</p>
<p>§8.2 — Content &amp; Safety Policy (Artistic‑Only Public Surfaces,
Reporting, Moderation)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define what is allowed on public surfaces and how Safe‑Mode
works.<br />
• Provide clear reporting, review, and appeal paths that respect
creators and protect viewers.<br />
• Prevent harassment, hate, doxxing, and risky off‑platform
arrangements.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to profiles, search cards, feeds, messaging previews, and any
public‑facing media. Private deliverables may include mature content if
lawful and consented, but they are delivered via external links and not
hosted by us.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Artistic nudity: non‑sexualized displays of the human body used in
creative expression or documentary work.<br />
• Explicit sexual content: acts, genitals in sexual context, or fetish
material; not permitted on public surfaces.<br />
• Safe‑Mode: default setting that blurs or hides sensitive thumbnails
for guests and first‑time viewers; toggle for signed‑in adults.<br />
• Harassment: unwanted conduct that targets a person; includes threats,
sexual harassment, doxxing.<br />
• Doxxing: publishing private identifying information without
consent.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Public media criteria: allow artistic nudity; disallow explicit sex
acts and fetish content on public pages.<br />
• Consent requirements: all persons depicted must be 18+; no minors even
in background; creators affirm consent and ownership.<br />
• No harassment or hate: zero tolerance for threats, slurs, or
dehumanization; removal and sanctions escalate.<br />
• No illegal content: weapons solicitation, trafficking, drugs, and
fraud are prohibited.<br />
• Safe‑Mode defaults: guests and first‑time viewers see blurred
sensitive thumbnails; adults can opt in after acknowledgment.<br />
• NSFW label: creators must self‑label sensitive sets; classifiers add
secondary checks; moderators resolve disputes.<br />
• Appeals: structured path with second‑level review; examples published
to reduce ambiguity.<br />
• Location safety: discourage posting precise home addresses; studio
addresses handled via verified studio listings.<br />
• Messaging protections: rate limits, spam detection, PII redaction
options (support), and report/ block.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Intake → triage → action flow: content reported triggers a queue;
moderators evaluate policy fit; actions applied with templates.<br />
• Escalation: high‑risk items (potential exploitation, credible threats)
escalate to T&amp;S lead and legal; involve law enforcement where
appropriate.<br />
• Education loop: add clarifying examples to help center when ambiguity
recurs; tune classifiers to reduce false positives.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Tiered responses: label, blur, age‑gate, remove; repeat violations
escalate to strikes and disable; IB suppression during
investigations.<br />
• Harassment outcomes: blocks, message restrictions, and account holds;
doxxing treated as severe violation.<br />
• False‑positive safety net: quick appeal channel; restore with apology
copy when moderation erred.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• PII minimization in reports and queues; moderator access restricted
and audited; redaction tools for public pages.<br />
• Media retention: we store only thumbnails and metadata for moderation;
full files remain in external storage controlled by the creator.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Moderator templates: decision rationales; user copies for
blur/label/remove; appeal receipts; escalation one‑pagers.<br />
• Safe‑Mode explainer: visual examples; toggle confirmation; guest
banner copy.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Safety reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversal rates; classifier
precision/recall; IB suppression counts; time‑to‑action SLAs.<br />
• Harassment recurrence after intervention; user trust scores in
post‑moderation surveys.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Over‑ or under‑moderation → calibrate classifiers; publish examples;
empower appeals.<br />
• Creator backlash → provide transparent explanations; avoid
condescending tone; keep humans in loop for close calls.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Policy page with examples live; Safe‑Mode default verified; moderation
queues staffed; classifier thresholds tested; appeal paths
documented.</p>

or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Offer optional background checks (Trusted Pro) that enhance safety
without becoming a barrier to entry.<br />
• Implement FCRA‑compliant flows for consent, notices, disputes, and
adverse action.<br />
• Protect privacy and prevent misuse of background data.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to providers who opt into the Trusted Pro program and to buyers
where a studio or brand requires checks for on‑premise work. Background
checks are not mandatory to browse or book unless specified by a
studio’s house rules.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Background Check: a consumer report from a screening vendor provided
with the provider’s written authorization.<br />
• Pre‑Adverse Action Notice: a notice sent when we might take an action
based in whole or part on the report.<br />
• Adverse Action Notice: a final notice if action is taken (e.g.,
denying Trusted Pro badge).<br />
• Permissible Purpose: the reason we may request a report (safety for
marketplace participation).</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Consent: explicit, informed, written consent is required; separate
from ToS; withdrawable at any time.<br />
• Scope: limited to identity verification, criminal records where
lawful, and sex offender registries; no credit checks for
creators.<br />
• Use: report is used solely to grant or deny Trusted Pro; not for
unrelated decisions; no sharing with other users.<br />
• Adverse action: if considering a negative decision, send pre‑adverse
notice with report copy and rights; wait required period before final
decision.<br />
• Disputes: if user disputes accuracy, pause action until vendor
resolves; document outcomes; re‑evaluate decision.<br />
• Data retention: store minimal artifacts; delete per vendor and legal
schedules; restrict admin access with training.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Flow: consent capture → vendor run → results to restricted queue →
decision template (approve/consider/insufficient) → notice steps (if
consider) → final outcome → badge or denial.<br />
• Training: FCRA basics for Trust admins; scripts for notices; time‑zone
aware waiting periods.<br />
• Vendor audits: quarterly SLAs, dispute timelines, and data security
attestations.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Outcomes: approve (badge issued), insufficient (ask for resubmission),
pre‑adverse + adverse (with required waits), appeal path if new
information supplied.<br />
• Misuse: any admin misuse is a severe policy breach; logs reviewed;
employment actions may result.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• PII vault for reports; masked views by default; access logs reviewed;
retention periods enforced; legal hold overrides documented.<br />
• End‑user privacy: no sharing of report content with other users; we
surface only badge/no‑badge and generic safety copy.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: consent form; pre‑adverse notice; adverse action notice;
dispute intake; approval email; badge explainer.<br />
• Admin checklists: steps for each outcome; timers for waiting periods;
escalation paths.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Completion time; adverse action accuracy; dispute resolution time;
badge adoption; appeal success rates; access‑log anomalies.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Jurisdictional variation → vendor handles localization; we allow city
gates if requirements differ.<br />
• Over‑reliance on checks → emphasize that reviews and reputation remain
primary; do not imply 'guarantee' of safety.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />

completed; notice templates reviewed by counsel; badge logic validated
in search and fees.</p>

<p>§8.4 — Contracts &amp; IP (SOW, Model Releases, Licensing Tiers)</p>
<p>§8.4 — Contracts &amp; IP (SOW, Model Releases, Licensing Tiers)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a

Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Provide standard templates and a Smart Docs system that aligns
expectations and IP rights before the shoot.<br />
• Prevent downstream disputes over usage by capturing license scope and
compensation clearly.<br />
• Respect creators’ copyrights while enabling buyers to license what
they need.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all paid bookings where deliverables or usage rights are
exchanged via the platform. TFP/collaboration bookings may use
lightweight agreements but still require model releases where faces are
identifiable.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Statement of Work (SOW): scope, deliverables, timeline, compensation,
change‑order process.<br />
• Model Release: consent by a person depicted to use their likeness
under specified terms.<br />
• License: the permission granted by the rights holder to use content in
defined ways; may be exclusive or nonexclusive.<br />
• Assignment: transfer of ownership of the IP; rare and requires
explicit agreement and additional compensation.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Default posture: the creator (photographer/videographer) owns the
copyright; buyers obtain a license selected at checkout.<br />
• License tiers: social/web; advertising; commercial print; broadcast;
each with territory/duration options and price add‑ons.<br />
• Model releases: required for identifiable persons; stored with
booking; expiration and revocation terms spelled out.<br />
• Change orders: add‑on licenses post‑shoot are supported; receipts
amended; SOW updated in Smart Docs.<br />
• Moral rights: where applicable, we avoid derogatory treatment clauses;
we permit credit removal if safety requires.<br />
• No hidden assignments: platform license is limited to hosting,
processing, and displaying content for the service.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Pre‑shoot: SOW and release e‑sign; deliverables and license selected;
both parties see plain‑English summaries.<br />
• Post‑shoot: deliverables manifest posted; acceptance triggers license
effectiveness; upgrades handled via change order.<br />
• Disputes: receipts, SOW, and releases become the definitive record;
support follows playbook to assess scope.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Breach: failure to deliver or misuse of content triggers remedies
(refunds, takedown, license suspension).<br />
• Infringement: DMCA process for third‑party claims; internal
investigation where platform features are misused.<br />
• Bad‑faith buyers/providers: sanctions include loss of Trusted Pro,
promotions eligibility, or account limits.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• Data retention: SOW/releases stored 7 years; hashes captured for
integrity; minimal PII in public artifacts.<br />
• Privacy: releases and SOW not publicly displayed; only status and
scope summaries shown to the counterparty.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: SOW per role; model release variants; license matrix;
change‑order terms; takedown request forms.<br />
• Help‑center: 'Which license do I need?' wizard; examples of common
scenarios.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Dispute rate related to license scope; frequency of change‑order
upgrades; time‑to‑sign for SOW/releases; takedown SLAs.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Ambiguous license language → publish examples; require plain‑English
summaries; prohibit hidden assignments.<br />
• Edge cases (e.g., collage, AI stylization) → add addenda and clarify
derivative works rights.</p>

<p>§8.5 — Payments, Refunds &amp; Chargebacks (Consumer Law Notes)</p>
<p>§8.5 — Payments, Refunds &amp; Chargebacks (Consumer Law Notes)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Explain money flows plainly and enforce refund/cancellation windows
consistently.<br />
• Maximize successful representment in disputes by keeping clean records
(escrow, manifests, timestamps).<br />
• Avoid unfair practices; provide accessible help‑center content that
sets expectations.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all escrowed transactions, ACH and card payments, deposits,
cancellations, and post‑booking adjustments within the US.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Escrow: funds held until acceptance; release triggers defined in §1.3
and §4.12.<br />
• Change Order: a mutually agreed price/time adjustment posted to the
thread; amends receipts and escrow.<br />
• Chargeback: cardholder disputes a charge with issuer; we respond with
evidence.<br />
• ACH Return: bank rejects a debit; we handle via returns codes, fees,
and communication.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Clear disclosures: fees, taxes, deposits, and refund windows displayed
before purchase and in receipts.<br />
• Refund bands: time‑based buyer refunds; provider‑fault refunds include
buyer fee; late cancels tracked for reputation.<br />
• Chargeback playbook: gather SOW, releases, chats, acceptance,
manifest; construct a concise narrative; file within deadline.<br />
• ACH handling: post returns code; adjust buyer fee if method changes;
reattempt under policy.<br />
• No cash: off‑platform payments are prohibited within the UI; repeated
attempts can throttle messaging.<br />
• Tips: zero platform fee; optional and processed post‑completion.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Support macros: standard refunds; reschedule; partial refunds;
provider‑fault; chargeback kits.<br />
• Admin tools: re‑issue receipts; partial refund apportionment; deposit
auth/capture logs for studios.<br />
• Finance close: daily reconciliation; settlement variance alarms; tax
export by jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Outcomes: refund issued, denied (with rationale), partial; chargeback
won/lost; ACH return resolved.<br />
• Abuse controls: refund/chargeback abuse flags; repeat offenders lose
Instant Book or are limited.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• Sensitive data: card/ACH tokens only; we never store PANs; PII vaulted
and masked; least‑privilege on admin pages.<br />
• Retention: receipts kept per finance policy; chargeback evidence
retained for at least 18 months.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: refund confirmations; chargeback narratives; ACH return
explanations; late‑cancel warnings.<br />
• Help‑center: 'How refunds work,' 'What happens in a dispute,'
'Deposits for studios,' 'Tips &amp; payouts'.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Refund SLA; representment win rate; settlement variance; ACH return
rate; average time to resolution; user satisfaction scores for money
tickets.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Ambiguous refund copy → standardize; preview math in price box; reduce
surprises.<br />
• Evidence gaps → require manifest and acceptance; reduce 'not as
described' disputes with SOW clarity.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Macros published; finance reports green 14/14 days; chargeback kit
quality audits ≥ 95%; dispute loss rate trending down.</p>

<p>§8.6 — Sales‑Tax &amp; Marketplace Facilitator Stance (State Matrix;
Tax Engine)</p>
<p>§8.6 — Sales‑Tax &amp; Marketplace Facilitator Stance (State Matrix;
Tax Engine)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests

Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Rely on a tax engine for jurisdiction determination and rate
calculation; avoid hard‑coding volatile rules.<br />
• Document when we act as collector vs when the provider does, based on
service type and state posture.<br />
• Ensure receipts and exports itemize tax correctly; support amendments
and refunds.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to taxable services and fees in the United States where state or
local law imposes sales or similar transaction taxes. At launch we rely
on a tax engine configured for US‑only; coverage expands city‑by‑city
per §6.3.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Marketplace facilitator: a platform obligated in some jurisdictions to
collect/ remit tax on third‑party sales.<br />
• Taxable base: the portion of the transaction subject to tax (service,
fees, deposits if captured).<br />
• Sourcing: origin‑based vs destination‑based rules for services;
determined by the engine using addresses.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Engine‑first policy: we use tax provider quotes at checkout and store
a tax transaction id; we do not invent rates.<br />
• Role mapping: talent services vs studio rentals may be taxed
differently; we configure item categories accordingly.<br />
• Receipts: show tax lines by leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposits taxed if jurisdiction requires.<br />
• Refunds &amp; amendments: credit memos issued through the engine;
partial refunds adjust tax proportionally.<br />
• Allowlist rollout: only enable tax in states we have configured and
tested; show banner where tax is not yet collected.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Admin tax map: city/state allowlist; category mapping; override flags
when the engine is down.<br />
• Nightly reconciliation: totals by jurisdiction; exception report for
missing tax ids; SLA checks for latency.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Outcomes: tax collected &amp; remitted via engine; tax not applicable;
or pending due to outage (with user banner).<br />
• Mis‑classification: fix mapping; issue adjustments; document in
reconciliation logs.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• PII minimization: addresses and TINs stored in vault; tax data limited
to what is required; logs scrubbed.<br />
• Retention: export archives per finance schedule; legal holds paused
when necessary.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: tax‑enabled banner copy; 'tax not collected yet in your
state' banner; reconciliation playbook; outage copy.<br />
• Help‑center: 'How taxes work,' 'Why was tax charged?,' 'Which services
are taxed?'</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Tax latency; quote success rate; reconciliation variance; number of
overrides; user contacts about tax confusion.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Volatile rules → centralize in engine; avoid bespoke logic in app;
maintain a small allowlist for coverage.<br />
• User confusion → show simple copy and itemized receipts; link to help
center; keep support macros ready.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Engine configured; allowlist published; receipts itemize correctly;
nightly reconciliation and exports passing for 30 days.</p>

<p>§8.7 — Data Protection &amp; PII (Public‑Facing Summary of §5.7)</p>
<p>§8.7 — Data Protection &amp; PII (Public‑Facing Summary of §5.7)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Explain plainly what data we collect, why, and how we protect
it.<br />
• Honor least‑privilege access, masking, and audit trails for PII.<br />
• Offer user controls (exports, deletion where applicable) and clear
contact channels.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all personal data processed in connection with accounts,
bookings, messaging, payments, and safety operations within the United
States.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• PII: information that identifies a person (e.g., name, email, phone)
and sensitive identifiers (DOB, TIN).<br />
• Vault: secure store for sensitive fields; access restricted and
audited.<br />
• Data Subject Request (DSR): a user request for access, correction, or
deletion of their data where applicable.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Data minimization: collect only what we need to operate and secure the
service (identity, payments, safety).<br />
• Purpose limitation: do not repurpose data for unrelated advertising;
usage limited to service operations and safety.<br />
• Security: encryption in transit and at rest; tokenized payments;
masked PII in admin; JIT elevation for sensitive unmasking.<br />
• User controls: profile edits; download receipts; data export on
request; account closure flow with data retention explanation.<br />
• Third parties: share data only with processors and vendors necessary
to deliver the service; contracts require security and privacy
safeguards.<br />
• Children: 18+ only; remove accounts if discovered to be underage;
report where required.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• DSR flow: intake → verify identity → scope data → fulfill → log;
denial templates for narrow exceptions.<br />
• Breach response: incident roles; containment; notification thresholds;
post‑mortem with remediation tasks.<br />
• Access reviews: quarterly RBAC review; remove stale admin accounts;
rotate secrets on schedule.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Enforcement: violations of access policy trigger investigation;
repeated misuse leads to employment action; all actions audited.<br />
• Appeals: users can escalate DSR outcomes via support; internal privacy
officer reviews edge cases.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• Retention schedule: finance records, releases, and SOW timelines;
purge jobs for expired artifacts; legal hold overrides documented.<br />
• Transparency: publish privacy summary with last‑updated date; log of
material changes.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: DSR intake; identity verification steps; breach notice
skeleton; privacy summary page; vendor due‑diligence checklist.<br />
• Training decks: PII handling and phishing drills; admin console
privacy controls primer.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• DSR SLA; time to revoke stale admin access; secrets rotation
adherence; privacy incident count; audit of PII access logs.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Over‑collection → reduce fields and retention; Vault misuse → increase
audits and training; vendor risk → conduct due diligence and
monitoring.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Privacy summary published; DSR tooling live; access review calendar
set; breach runbook tested; vendor checklist adopted.</p>

<p>§8.8 — Subpoena &amp; Law‑Enforcement Process (With §4.14.15
Hooks)</p>
<p>§8.8 — Subpoena &amp; Law‑Enforcement Process (With §4.14.15
Hooks)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Respond lawfully and narrowly to valid legal process while protecting
user privacy and safety.<br />
• Provide an emergency disclosure path for imminent harm consistent with
law.<br />
• Maintain impeccable audit trails and chain‑of‑custody for any data
disclosed.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all requests from government entities, private litigants, and
law enforcement seeking user data.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Legal Process: a subpoena, court order, or warrant that compels
disclosure of certain records.<br />
• Emergency Disclosure: a request asserting imminent harm to a person;
processed under a defined policy.<br />
• Notice: where permitted by law, informing users that their data has
been requested.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Intake: verify authority, scope, and jurisdiction; reject over‑broad
or improper requests; require correct service.<br />
• Notice: unless legally barred, inform the user with a copy of the
request and time to object.<br />
• Narrow tailoring: produce only what is specified; prefer metadata over
content where lawful.<br />
• Chain of custody: hash and inventory produced files; store in
restricted evidence repository.<br />
• Emergency requests: accept via official channels; require written
confirmation; log and review post‑hoc.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Admin integration: §4.14.15 legal holds; evidence tagging; restricted
access groups.<br />
• Escalation: counsel reviews; senior approval for content disclosures;
regular audits of requests.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Enforcement: deny improper requests; seek to quash where appropriate;
document refusals and reasons.<br />
• Abuse reporting: if a request appears abusive, escalate; do not comply
until clarified.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• PII minimization in productions; redact third‑party PII where not
requested; secure transfer methods; retention per legal hold
schedule.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: subpoena intake form; user notice; emergency disclosure
form; production cover letter; denial letter.<br />
• Logs: request register with dates, types, outcomes; annual
transparency report summary.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Request volume; mean time to legal review; % of requests narrowed;
transparency report cadence.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Improper service → train intake; scope creep → insist on narrow
requests; confidentiality orders → track notice restrictions and
expiry.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Counsel on retainer; intake mailbox monitored; evidence repository
configured; transparency report template ready.</p>

<p>§8.9 — Accessibility &amp; Anti‑Discrimination Commitments</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)

Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Deliver equitable access to the platform and prohibit discrimination
by users in listings and bookings.<br />
• Commit to WCAG 2.1 AA and continuous accessibility improvement.<br />
• Protect users from harassment and discriminatory conduct in content
and messages.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to all product surfaces, content, and user interactions.
Providers and buyers must comply with non‑discrimination rules in their
offers and conduct.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Accessibility: making content usable by people with disabilities,
including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive.<br />
• Discrimination: unfavorable treatment based on protected classes
(e.g., race, gender, disability, religion, sexual orientation).<br />
• Accommodation: reasonable modifications to policies and practices
where appropriate.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• WCAG commitment: design system patterns aim for 2.1 AA; audits
scheduled; defects tracked like product bugs.<br />
• Non‑discrimination: providers may define genre/skill/availability
criteria but may not refuse work based on protected classes.<br />
• Harassment policy: aligned with §8.2; zero tolerance for slurs,
targeting, or exclusionary conduct.<br />
• Accommodation: support channels for accessibility needs; studio house
rules must include accessible entry info where applicable.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Accessibility QA: keyboard nav tests, contrast checks, screen reader
flows; bug triage and regression tests.<br />
• Enforcement: report intake for discrimination; evidence review;
proportionate actions; education first where misunderstanding is
likely.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Outcomes: warning, content removal, booking cancellation support, or
account limits; repeat violations escalate.<br />
• Appeals: allow users to contest decisions; moderators consider context
and cultural sensitivity.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• Data: avoid collecting protected class data unless required for law;
do not use protected attributes in ranking or promotions.<br />
• Privacy: accommodation requests handled discreetly; limited
visibility; retention minimal.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Templates: accessibility statement; discrimination policy; report
forms; accommodation request flows; guidance for studio accessibility
disclosure.<br />
• Training: inclusive language for support; accessible design patterns
for product and marketing.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Accessibility defect rate; time to fix high‑severity accessibility
bugs; discrimination report outcomes; user satisfaction among
screen‑reader users.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Token compliance without usability → test with real users; uneven
enforcement → publish examples and decisions to reduce ambiguity.</p>

<p>§8.10 — Compliance Calendar (Filings, Policy Reviews, Audits)</p>
<p>§8.10 — Compliance Calendar (Filings, Policy Reviews, Audits)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is a policy and process blueprint intended
for product and operations planning. It does not constitute legal, tax,
or compliance advice. Consult qualified counsel before publishing
external policies or taking actions that create legal obligations. All
examples are illustrative and may need adaptation for
jurisdiction‑specific law.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We are launching a US‑only creative
marketplace focused on models, photographers, videographers, and content
creators.<br />
We have chosen a subscription‑free go‑to‑market with monetization via
take‑rate and optional, usage‑based promotions that are
eligibility‑gated and capped.<br />
Public content is artistic‑nudity‑only; Safe‑Mode defaults for guests
apply. Deliverables are transferred via external storage (Drive/Dropbox)
with immutable manifests.<br />
Payments flow through card (3DS where required) and ACH (with a
buyer‑fee discount); funds are escrowed and released on
acceptance.<br />
Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Feature flags and city gates are used for reversible,
auditable launches.<br />
Admin consoles enable Support, Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, and Ops to
perform routine tasks without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Create a predictable cadence for legal and compliance tasks so nothing
is reactive.<br />
• Bundle policy reviews with product milestones; keep public pages fresh
and versioned.<br />
• Audit vendors and internal controls on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Scope &amp; Applicability:<br />
Applies to Trust &amp; Safety, Finance, Legal, and Data teams;
coordinated by an owner who maintains the shared calendar.</p>
<p>Definitions (plain language):<br />
• Quarterly: policy reviews, RBAC access review, vendor SLAs and
security attestations, data retention jobs audit.<br />
• Monthly: finance close QA, tax reconciliation, promotions
invalid‑click review, privacy access ledger report.<br />
• Annual: SOC evidence pack progress, pentest, DMCA agent check,
ADA/accessibility review, disaster recovery drill.</p>
<p>Policy Statements:<br />
• Owners: named DRI for each recurring task; backups assigned;
escalations defined.<br />
• Artifacts: checklists stored in admin; timestamps captured; outcomes
posted to an internal 'compliance log'.<br />
• City‑by‑city: calendar reflects city launches; tasks added as tax,
promotions, and studios enable in new cities.</p>
<p>Procedures &amp; Operational Playbooks:<br />
• Enforcement: missed tasks trigger escalation; repeat misses lead to
process changes; calendar visible to execs.<br />
• Risk‑based prioritization: high‑risk tasks take precedence during
incident weeks; low‑risk items may defer with approval.</p>
<p>Enforcement &amp; Remedies:<br />
• Data hygiene: purge jobs verified; evidence repositories trimmed;
legal holds reviewed and released when resolved.<br />
• Privacy: DSR volume monitored; training refreshers scheduled; secrets
rotation logged.</p>
<p>Data, Privacy &amp; Retention:<br />
• Templates: quarterly review checklist; RBAC access review form; vendor
questionnaire; DR drill script; SOC evidence index.<br />
• Dashboards: compliance status board; upcoming deadlines; error budgets
for misses.</p>
<p>Templates &amp; Required Notices (internal/external):<br />
• Task completion rate; on‑time rate; audit findings; vendor remediation
rates; incident reduction post‑reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance Metrics &amp; Audits:<br />
• Calendar sprawl → consolidate and assign DRIs; drift between policy
and product → tie reviews to release trains.<br />
• Vendor fatigue → rotate deep‑dives; keep a minimal baseline
questionnaire for low‑risk vendors.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Calendar published; owners and backups named; first cycle completed
with notes; dashboard showing green/yellow/red for each area.</p>
<p>Acceptance Checklist (ready to externalize):<br />
□ Counsel review completed; public pages staged with versioning.<br />
□ Admin tools wired (queues, redaction, approvals) with audit
trails.<br />
□ Training delivered to Support/T&amp;S/Finance; templates
published.<br />
□ Feature flags and city allowlists configured; rollback tested.<br />
□ Telemetry and dashboards live; acceptance tests passed.</p>
<p>Deep Dive: Scenario — Unsafe off‑platform interaction: intake,
escalation, and law‑enforcement coordination.<br />

<p>Section 9 — Financial Model &amp; Unit Economics (9.0–9.8)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 22:41:06 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section is a detailed write‑up (≥2,500 words) with formulas
and acceptance checklists aligned to Sections 1–8.</p>
<p>§9.0 — Modeling Assumptions (Traffic, Conversion, City Ramp)</p>
<p>§9.0 — Modeling Assumptions (Traffic, Conversion, City Ramp)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Establish realistic, testable assumptions for traffic, conversion, and
growth that tie to product flags and city gates.<br />
• Align finance with measurement: every assumption maps to an event or
metric in §5.<br />
• Create a baseline and two alt scenarios (conservative/aggressive)
without overfitting early noise.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Cities &amp; cohorts: Houston (Cohort‑1) GA at T+90; City‑2 pilot at
T+180; City‑3 at T+240 under §6.4 readiness.<br />
• Supply (providers): Active providers = listed + ID‑verified with ≥1
package; Trusted Pro as a subset.<br />
• Demand (buyers): Active buyers = ≥1 inquiry or booking in trailing 28
days.<br />
• Conversion: Search→Inquiry (S→I) and Inquiry→Booking (I→B) defined in
§6; rep score &amp; Instant Book shift these.<br />
• GMV: Gross value of bookings excluding buyer fee and tax; sum of
subtotals per leg.<br />
• AOV: Average order value per leg; varies by role and city tier.<br />
• Cancellations: Time‑banded rates; late cancels affect reputation and
rebooking behavior.<br />
• Chargebacks: Rate on card transactions; ACH has different failure
profile (returns).<br />
• Payment mix: Card vs ACH share; ACH reduces buyer fee but lowers
processing cost.<br />
• Promotions adoption: Share of eligible providers purchasing
CPC/Featured; ROAS targets from §3.3.<br />
• Tax coverage: Allowlist states per §4.12/§6.3; banner when off.<br />
• Seasonality: Minor seasonality; spikes near holidays and local event
seasons.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• ActiveProviders_t = NewProviders_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t<br />
• ActiveBuyers_t = NewBuyers_t + Reactivated_t − Churn_t<br />
• Inquiries_t = Searches_t × (S→I) × EligibilityRate_t<br />
• Bookings_t = Inquiries_t × (I→B) × (1 − CancelRate_t)<br />
• GMV_t = Σ (BookingSubtotal_i) for all completed legs in period t<br />
• AOV_role,city = GMV_role,city / Bookings_role,city<br />
• TakeRate_net ≈ (ProviderFee% × GMV) + BuyerFee% × GMV_equiv +
PromotionsRevenue − ProcessorCOGS − VariableOpsCOGS</p>
<p>Cohort maturation curves:<br />
Supply tends to mature faster than demand in creator marketplaces. We
model a s‑curve for provider activation (profile→IDV→first package→first
booking) and a slightly slower curve for buyer repeat rate. These curves
are parameterized so we can fit them once we have 8–12 weeks of
telemetry.</p>
<p>Eligibility &amp; gating:<br />
Availability, distance, price fit, and NSFW toggle are filters that
reduce the eligible supply set a buyer sees. Promotions never expand
eligibility; they only surface within matching results.</p>
<p>Data discipline:<br />
Every assumption above maps to a field or table in the §5 warehouse
(fact_search, fact_inquiry, fact_booking_leg, fact_payment, fact_promo).
Finance does not hard‑code rates; we consume aggregates from Gold tables
with freshness SLOs.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Search→Inquiry and Inquiry→Booking (city×role) with 7/14/28d
trends<br />
• Active providers and buyers (28d) with growth and churn by
cohort<br />
• GMV, AOV, and leg count by city×role<br />
• Cancellation and chargeback rates by payment type<br />
• ACH share of checkouts; promotions adoption and ROAS by role×city</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Early noise overfitting → use ranges and guardrails; wait for stable
cohorts before revising baselines.<br />
• Mis‑measured eligibility → implement precise denominator definitions
and audits in §5.8.<br />
• Seasonality misreads → annotate events (festivals, holidays) in a
calendar dimension.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Assumptions document reviewed monthly; deltas tied to observed
telemetry.<br />
□ Cohort curves parameterized and ready to fit after 8–12 weeks of
data.<br />
□ Gold tables for search, inquiry, booking, and payment pass DQ
gates.</p>
<p>Modeling Deep‑Dive:<br />
• Scenario setup: Define a city cohort with starting supply and demand,
apply search→inquiry and inquiry→booking rates from §6.2/§6.3, then
layer on cancellations, lateness, and chargebacks. Compute GMV per
cohort and pass it through fee structure, taxes, and processor
costs.<br />
• Unit economics: For a representative $X booking, compute provider fee
(12%), buyer fee (5% or 3% with ACH), and processing cost. Show platform
net before variable ops (content safety scans, IDV/BG subsidies). Repeat
for small (≤$150), mid ($300–$600), and large (&gt;$1,000)
bookings.<br />
• Promotions ROI: Using holdouts, estimate incremental GMV from paid
exposure. Attribute revenue to promotions net of invalid‑click credits.
Ensure quality score and eligibility keep paid from cannibalizing
organic relevance.<br />
• Sensitivity toggles: Vary ACH adoption (10–40%), chargebacks
(0.2–0.6%), cancellations (3–10%), and promotions adoption (5–25%) to
see contribution margin swings.<br />
• City expansion: Add a second city with a 3–6 month lag. Reuse
maturation curves and observe shared services leverage (support,
SRE).</p>

<p>§9.1 — Revenue Drivers (Take‑Rate, Promotions, Other)</p>
<p>§9.1 — Revenue Drivers (Take‑Rate, Promotions, Other)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define all revenue streams with formulas that tie to product behavior
and receipts.<br />
• Make revenue recognition auditable via booking legs, receipts, and
promotions wallet.<br />
• Avoid vanity revenue—focus on durable drivers aligned with user
value.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Provider fee: 12% of booking subtotal; drops to 10% on portion &gt;
$1,000; −1% Instant Book; −0.5% Trusted Pro (floor 9%).<br />
• Buyer fee: 5% (min $3); 3% with ACH where enabled; refunded on
provider‑fault cancels.<br />
• Promotions: Search Boost (CPC) and Featured (weekly flat) usage‑based
with eligibility; clear caps and labels.<br />
• Tips: 0% platform fee; processed post‑completion (not revenue).<br />
• Other: None at launch (no subscriptions); potential future add‑ons
deferred to §13.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• Revenue_provider_fees_t = Σ (ProviderFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) over
completed legs i<br />
• Revenue_buyer_fees_t = Σ (BuyerFeeRate_i × Subtotal_i) adjusted for
refunds and ACH discount<br />
• Revenue_promotions_t = CPC_clicks_t × CPC_price_t + Featured_slots_t ×
Weekly_price_t<br />
• NetRevenue_t = Revenue_provider_fees_t + Revenue_buyer_fees_t +
Revenue_promotions_t − ProcessorCOGS_t − Credits_invalid_clicks_t</p>
<p>Why buyer fee exists:<br />
Buyer fee offsets processor costs and support while keeping provider
take‑home attractive. The ACH discount aligns incentives by reducing
both processor cost and buyer fee, encouraging low‑cost rails.</p>
<p>Promotions alignment:<br />
Promotions generate revenue only when providers opt in, and only within
relevance caps. Holdouts quantify incremental GMV so providers spend
when it pays, not because ranking is rigged.</p>
<p>Recognition timing:<br />
Provider and buyer fees are recognized when the leg completes or is
accepted; promotions revenue is recognized as clicks/impressions
deliver; credits for invalid clicks reduce promotions revenue as
contra‑revenue.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Take‑rate components: provider vs buyer vs promotions (stacked) by
city×role<br />
• Promotions adoption, CPC, CTR, ROAS distribution; invalid‑click credit
rate<br />
• ACH share and its effect on buyer fee and processor COGS<br />
• Refunded buyer fees due to provider‑fault cancels</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Perception of pay‑to‑win → capped slots, labels, eligibility gates;
transparency in 'Why am I seeing this?'<br />
• Buyer fee backlash → clear value copy (escrow, contracts, support) and
ACH discount messaging<br />
• Revenue leakage via off‑platform payments → in‑chat warnings,
throttles, Trusted Pro incentives</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Revenue lines reconcile to receipts (per leg) and promotions wallet
events.<br />
□ Invalid‑click credits pipeline operational; audits sampled
weekly.<br />
□ ACH effect on buyer fee and processing cost visible in dashboards.</p>

<p>§9.2 — COGS (Processing, Trust/Safety, Tax, Deliverables, Comms)</p>
<p>§9.2 — COGS (Processing, Trust/Safety, Tax, Deliverables, Comms)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Identify all variable costs tied directly to transactions and
exposure.<br />
• Model processor fees for card vs ACH correctly; capture per‑event
costs (IDV, BG, tax, comms, safety).<br />
• Keep COGS low without compromising safety or compliance.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Card processing: Assume ~2.9% + $0.30 per card charge (authorization
and capture as applicable); 3DS where required.<br />
• ACH processing: Assume ~0.5–0.8% effective with caps; returns handling
cost per event.<br />
• ID verification: Per‑check cost; subsidized for early cohorts; later
user‑paid or bundled in Trusted Pro pricing.<br />
• Background checks: Pass‑through or partially subsidized; include
adverse‑action processing overhead.<br />
• Tax engine: Per transaction quote + monthly minimum;
refunds/amendments charged per credit memo.<br />
• Content safety: Classifier scans per media; human moderation minutes
for escalations.<br />
• E‑signature: Per envelope for SOW/releases; negotiated tiers.<br />
• SMS/email: Per SMS/segment and email send; deliverability
monitoring.<br />
• Chargeback fees: Per dispute fee; lost cases incur processor fees;
representment labor cost.<br />
• Invalid‑click credits: Reducing promotions revenue; monitoring and
auto‑credit pipeline cost.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• ProcessorCOGS_t = Σ (CardCharges_j × (rate% × amount_j + $0.30)) + Σ
(ACHDebits_k × (ach_rate% × amount_k))<br />
• TrustSafetyCOGS_t = IDV_checks × IDV_unit_cost + BG_checks ×
BG_unit_cost + Moderation_minutes × cost_per_min<br />
• TaxCOGS_t = TaxQuotes × quote_cost + CreditMemos × memo_cost<br />
• CommsCOGS_t = SMS_segments × sms_cost + Emails × email_cost<br />
• ChargebackCOGS_t = Disputes × dispute_fee + Losses ×
lost_rev_effect</p>
<p>External deliverables keep hosting COGS low:<br />
By using external storage for heavy media, we avoid large variable
storage and egress costs. We still incur classifier and moderation costs
on thumbnails and metadata.</p>
<p>Unit cost levers:<br />
Negotiating ACH pricing, batching signatures into envelopes, and
training classifiers to reduce human moderation minutes are key levers
on COGS.</p>
<p>Attribution discipline:<br />
COGS must reconcile with usage events in §5; finance uses event counts ×
unit costs and cross‑checks with vendor invoices and Admin exports.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• COGS % of GMV and % of revenue; processor cost per $ collected (card
vs ACH)<br />
• Moderation minutes per 1,000 media items; IDV/BG adoption vs subsidy
spend<br />
• Tax engine latency and success rate; credit memo accuracy; chargeback
win rate</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Processor fee creep → monitor effective rate; negotiate with volume;
shift mix to ACH where eligible<br />
• Under‑resourced moderation → safety risk; over‑moderation → creator
churn; balance with training and examples<br />
• Tax misconfiguration → reconciliation variance; keep allowlist tight
and audited</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ COGS model wired to vendor usage; reconciliation report green for 30
days.<br />
□ ACH return macros and fee handling tested; chargeback kit process
audited.<br />
□ Content safety staffing plan in place for peak loads.</p>

<p>§9.3 — Opex &amp; Headcount Plan (by Phase)</p>
<p>§9.3 — Opex &amp; Headcount Plan (by Phase)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Plan operating expense and headcount that unlock milestones without
over‑hiring.<br />
• Tie hiring to GA gates and city expansion; prefer contractors for
commodity tasks early.<br />
• Keep data/infra spend disciplined (≤15% of GMV).</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• People: Engineering, Product, Design, Data, SRE, Support, Trust,
Finance, City Ops, Marketing.<br />
• Vendors: Comms, e‑signature, background/IDV, tax, analytics,
observability, ticketing.<br />
• Facilities: Remote‑first; optional coworking; travel for city ops and
studio partners.<br />
• Tooling: Source control, CI/CD, security scans, feature flags,
experimentation, admin console.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• Payroll_t = Σ (FTE_role × fully_loaded_cost_role) +
Contractors_t<br />
• VendorOpex_t = Σ (SaaS_subscriptions) + Minimums (tax, comms) not in
COGS<br />
• TotalOpex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t</p>
<p>Phase‑linked hiring:<br />
We add squads as §6 milestones unlock: Beta adds Growth/Promotions; GA
adds Money/Tax and Studios; post‑GA adds SRE. Support and T&amp;S ramp
with ticket volume.</p>
<p>Contractor vs FTE:<br />
Use contractors for non‑differentiated tasks (e.g., help‑center
population, manual reviews) while retaining core differentiation
(search, booking, money, admin) in‑house.</p>
<p>Cost discipline:<br />
Finance reviews TB/day (data) and compute envelopes (§5.12). Feature
owners are accountable for admin operability to prevent support
burden.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Opex runway in months; burn multiple; payroll % of total opex; vendor
spend vs plan<br />
• Ticket volume per 1,000 legs; staffing vs SLA; error budget burn vs
engineer operating time</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Hiring ahead of demand → burn increases without revenue; mitigate with
gates<br />
• Under‑investing in SRE → reliability risk; mitigate with phased
on‑call and drills<br />
• Vendor sprawl → consolidate; maintain an approved vendor list and
renewal calendar</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Headcount plan per phase approved; offer templates ready; recruiting
funnel metrics live.<br />
□ Vendor roster with costs and owners published; renewal dates in
calendar.<br />
□ Runway and burn tracked monthly; alerts when thresholds breached.</p>

ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Establish a city‑first marketing plan with measurable CAC and payback
windows.<br />
• Use incentives (verification subsidies, Boost coupons) instead of
subscriptions to drive quality supply.<br />
• Balance organic loops (boards, posts, referrals) with targeted paid
tests.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Channels: Creator referrals, studio partners, social ads (limited
tests), content marketing, PR, email sequences, RFP broadcasts.<br />
• Incentives: IDV subsidies for early providers; Trusted Pro coupon;
buyer fee holidays for first booking in new city.<br />
• Budget framing: CAC caps relative to LTV; city‑level spend with clear
stop/go criteria.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• CAC_channel = Spend_channel /
NewActiveBuyers_or_Providers_from_channel<br />
• Payback_months = CAC / MonthlyContributionMargin_per_user<br />
• LTV_user = Σ (ContributionMargin_t × Retention_t) over horizon H</p>
<p>City‑first tactics:<br />
Leverage local studios, meetups, and micro‑influencers. Feature local
creators in home carousels. Offer limited buyer‑fee holidays
(time‑boxed) to spur first bookings.</p>
<p>Quality over volume:<br />
We avoid paying for low‑intent traffic. We favor channels that yield
ID‑verified providers and ready‑to‑book buyers.</p>
<p>Attribution:<br />
UTM discipline, post‑signup surveys, and blended CAC reporting prevent
false confidence in any one channel.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• CAC by channel; blended CAC; first‑booking rate; time to first
booking; repeat rate at 60/90 days<br />
• IDV adoption; Trusted Pro share; promotions usage among active
providers</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Vanity signups → require package publishing and first inquiry to count
as activation<br />
• Over‑spend on paid social → cap tests; demand ≥2× contribution payback
within 9–12 months<br />
• Referral fraud → limit per‑account rewards; require verified
activity</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ City marketing brief approved; budget caps and stop‑rules
configured.<br />
□ Referral tracking live; coupon issuance and abuse guards in
admin.<br />
□ Attribution dashboards validated with holdout cells where
feasible.</p>

<p>§9.5 — 24‑Month P&amp;L Scenarios (Base / Conservative /
Aggressive)</p>
<p>§9.5 — 24‑Month P&amp;L Scenarios (Base / Conservative /
Aggressive)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Provide a 24‑month P&amp;L structure with three scenarios tied to city
launches and product milestones.<br />
• Make it easy to update with real telemetry and to communicate to
stakeholders.<br />
• Ensure cash planning reflects realistic opex and COGS envelopes.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Horizon: 24 months from launch; quarterly checkpoints for board
updates.<br />
• Scenarios: Conservative (slower adoption), Base (plan), Aggressive
(faster promos ROI and ACH uptake).<br />
• City timing: Houston GA by ~Month 6; City‑2 Month 9; City‑3 Month 12
(if §6.4 gates pass).</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• Revenue_t = ProviderFees_t + BuyerFees_t + Promotions_t<br />
• COGS_t = Processor_t + TrustSafety_t + TaxEngine_t + Comms_t +
Chargeback_t<br />
• GrossMargin_t = Revenue_t − COGS_t<br />
• Opex_t = Payroll_t + VendorOpex_t + Facilities_t + Misc_t<br />
• EBITDA_t = GrossMargin_t − Opex_t<br />
• Cash_t = Cash_{t−1} + EBITDA_t − Capex_t</p>
<p>Scenario deltas:<br />
The aggressive case assumes higher ACH adoption (→ lower processing cost
but slightly lower buyer fee), higher promotions adoption with
sustainable ROAS, and faster IDV/Trusted Pro uptake improving
conversion.</p>
<p>Communication:<br />
We present scenarios as ranges with narrative drivers rather than
single‑point forecasts. Board updates highlight which drivers moved and
why.</p>
<p>Updating cadence:<br />
Monthly actuals roll into the model; quarterly we re‑baseline scenario
envelopes to maintain credibility.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• GMV growth by city; take‑rate mix; promotions revenue share; processor
cost as % of collections<br />
• Gross margin %; opex ratio; EBITDA trajectory; runway months at
current burn</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Optimism bias → keep conservative case plausible and funded; treat
aggressive as upside-only<br />
• Uncontrolled opex → hiring frozen until milestones; vendor renewals
scrutinized<br />
• City launch slips → build schedule slack; emphasize quality signals
before spend</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Scenario workbook built with inputs linked to §5 Gold tables.<br />
□ Quarterly board pack template prepared with red/yellow/green on key
drivers.<br />
□ Runway calculator validated with cash reconciliation.</p>

Cancellations)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Quantify how small changes in key inputs move contribution margin and
runway.<br />
• Prioritize levers that we can influence (ACH adoption, promotions
ROAS, cancellation policy).<br />
• Expose hidden convexities (e.g., chargebacks) early.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Levers: Provider fee floors; buyer fee ACH discount; promotions
adoption and CPC floors; studio attach; cancellation policy bands.<br />
• Friction terms: Chargeback rates; dispute win rate; tax engine
latency; moderation load; ACH returns.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• ΔContribution = ∂(Revenue − COGS)/∂x × Δx, evaluated at Base
scenario<br />
• Elasticity_ROAS = ∂GMV_incremental/∂CPC / CPC<br />
• ACH_effect = (ΔBuyerFee − ΔProcessorCost) at Δ(ACH share)</p>
<p>ACH lever:<br />
Higher ACH share reduces processor cost and buyer fee revenue; net
effect often positive due to cost savings and buyer conversion lift.</p>
<p>Promotions lever:<br />
Promotions revenue matters only if ROAS≥2.5× and invalid‑click credits
are low; we control CPC floors and density caps city‑by‑city.</p>
<p>Cancellation policy:<br />
Tighter late‑cancel penalties reduce waste but may reduce demand;
measure rebooking offsets and reputation effects.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Tornado chart of contribution drivers; ACH net effect; promotions
incremental GMV; cancellation impact on net revenue<br />
• Studio attach rate and deposit claim rates; effect on GMV and support
costs</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Over‑tuning to early data → require confidence intervals; avoid noisy
toggling<br />
• Hidden correlations → run multifactor analyses; keep experiments
orthogonal where possible</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Sensitivity dashboard live; drivers ranked by impact and
controllability.<br />
□ Levers with high impact assigned owners and experiments.<br />
□ Guardrails set for fee and CPC floor changes per city.</p>

<p>Goals:<br />
• Ensure 18–24 months of runway with conservative burn; tie hiring and
marketing unlocks to concrete milestones.<br />
• Define the metrics that unlock seed extension or Series A.<br />
• Provide a clear 'stop‑spend' protocol if KPIs regress.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• Starting cash: Seed proceeds net of fees; maintain minimum cash
covenant target.<br />
• Milestones: Beta KPIs (§6.2), GA KPIs (§6.3), City‑3 scale (§6.4),
promotions ROAS, tax coverage states.<br />
• Buffers: 3‑month buffer for city slips; vendor prepayments under
review.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />

• MarketingUnlock = 1 if (CAC_payback ≤ 12 months &amp; ROAS ≥ target)
else 0</p>
<p>Unlock criteria:<br />
We hire ahead only when revenue and trust metrics are sustainably on
track. Promotions GA scales when ROAS holds with caps.</p>
<p>Stop‑spend protocol:<br />
If two consecutive months miss red‑line KPIs, we pause hiring, reduce
paid marketing, and focus on conversion and trust fixes.</p>
<p>Investor narrative:<br />
We present a measured plan: city‑by‑city wins, strong NPS among
creators, and usage‑based monetization with fairness guardrails.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Runway months; burn multiple; EBITDA trend; CAC payback; ROAS; GMV per
active buyer/provider; NPS<br />
• Trust/share: IDV %, Trusted Pro %, safety reports per 1k legs; payout
latency; chargeback loss rate</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Over‑optimistic hiring → tie to unlock rules; publish 'freeze'
triggers<br />
• Unexpected processor fee hikes → multi‑processor readiness; ACH mix
push</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Runway calculator live; unlock/ freeze rules documented; comms plan
for spend changes.<br />
□ Board dashboard includes red/yellow/green gates on milestones.<br />
□ Cash reconciliation to bank statements completed monthly.</p>

<p>§9.8 — KPI Dashboard for Board Updates (Definitions &amp;
Sources)</p>
<p>§9.8 — KPI Dashboard for Board Updates (Definitions &amp;
Sources)</p>
<p>Financial Modeling Disclaimer: This section provides planning
assumptions, formulas, and structures for internal modeling. It is not a
forecast or financial advice. All sample numbers are illustrative;
replace with real inputs once telemetry in §5 is live.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: We operate a US‑only creative marketplace
connecting models, photographers, videographers, and content creators
with buyers and studios. Launch strategy is subscription‑free;
monetization is via take‑rate on bookings and usage‑based promotions
(capped, labeled, eligibility‑gated). Public content is artistic‑only;
deliverables use external storage with immutable manifests. Instant Book
requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro).
ACH reduces buyer fee to 3% where enabled. Feature flags and city gates
control rollout; admin tools and audits turn policy into software.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define the board‑level KPIs, their exact formulas, and their data
sources so updates are consistent.<br />
• Ensure every KPI is explainable and tied to controllable levers.<br />
• Standardize red/yellow/green thresholds with owners.</p>
<p>Key variables &amp; baselines:<br />
• KPI families: Liquidity (S→I, I→B), Growth (active buyers/providers),
Economics (GMV, take‑rate, margin), Trust (IDV %, safety), Payments (ACH
share, payout latency), Promotions (adoption, ROAS), Support (FRT,
FRR).<br />
• Sources: Gold tables from §5.5; event schemas from §5.1; freshness
SLOs from §5.12; admin actions from §4.14.*.</p>
<p>Core formulas (structure; plug real telemetry later):<br />
• S→I = Inquiries / Searches (eligible)<br />
• I→B = Bookings / Inquiries (eligible)<br />
• GMV = Σ booking subtotals (completed legs)<br />
• Take‑rate = (ProviderFee + BuyerFee + Promotions − ProcessorCOGS) /
GMV<br />
• ROAS (promotions) = Incremental GMV × TakeRate / PromotionsSpend<br />
• CAC_blended = TotalMarketingSpend / NewActiveBuyers (or providers)</p>
<p>Explainability:<br />
We show source events, denominators, and example calculations. For ROAS,
we use holdout incrementality—not naive last‑touch attribution.</p>
<p>Thresholds:<br />
Red/yellow/green bands are set from §6 targets. Thresholds are reviewed
quarterly and ratcheted only after sustained performance.</p>
<p>Presentation:<br />
Board deck uses consistent tiles with spark lines, YoY/period deltas,
and short 'what moved' memos per owner.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• KPI tile freshness (hours since last update); error budget burn;
number of data quality exceptions<br />
• Owner list with backups; on‑call data steward for board week</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Metric drift → lock definitions with a ledger; require changelog and
approver for edits<br />
• Gaming → monitor for anomalies; tie incentives to a basket of KPIs,
not a single metric</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist:<br />
□ Dashboard ready by T‑5 business days before board; freeze window
enforced.<br />
□ Single‑page appendix lists formulas and sources; DQ report
attached.<br />
□ Owners sign off on their tiles with short narratives.</p>

<p>Section 10 — Launch Playbooks &amp; Checklists (10.0–10.8)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 22:52:27 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section below is a detailed operational playbook (≥2,500
words) aligned to Sections 1–9.</p>
<p>§10.0 — Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists</p>
<p>§10.0 — Alpha → Beta → GA Readiness Checklists</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Gate each phase with objective, measurable criteria that reflect
trust, money, performance, and usability.<br />
• Prevent premature scaling by requiring admin operability and
auditability before GA.<br />
• Create clear ownership and escalation across squads for go/no‑go
decisions.</p>
<p>Alpha Exit (internal users + selected creators):<br />
□ Core loop works: search → inquiry → booking → deliverables manifest →
acceptance → payout queued.<br />
□ Admin: support can amend receipts, issue partial refunds, and view
audits without engineering help.<br />
□ Trust: IDV on; Safe‑Mode default; moderation queue staffing plan;
appeals path.<br />
□ Money: ACH enabled in sandbox; card 3DS tested; buyer fee math and
provider fee discounts validated.<br />
□ Data: §5 events land in Gold tables; dashboards for S→I, I→B, GMV
live; DQ gates pass.<br />
□ Docs: help‑center drafts for refunds, Safe‑Mode, deliverables
manifest; support macros.<br />
□ Flags: list of city gates and blast radii documented; rollback plans
linked.</p>
<p>Beta Entry (Houston public beta):<br />
□ Invite list seeded: 300–500 verified providers across roles; demand
waitlist activated.<br />
□ Support staffed for local hours; Trust trained on playbooks; finance
close daily green for 7 days.<br />
□ Tax engine on for allowlisted Texas rules; receipts itemize taxes
where applicable.<br />
□ Promotions disabled by default; holdouts and caps configured for later
v1.<br />
□ Performance SLOs met for search, messaging, checkout; synthetics are
green.</p>
<p>GA Entry (Houston):<br />
□ KPIs hit: S→I ≥ 20%, I→B ≥ 35%, repeat bookings ≥ 30% at 60
days.<br />
□ Dispute loss rate ≤ target; payout latency ≤ 48h; moderation SLA
met.<br />
□ Promotions v1 on with caps; ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; invalid‑click credit
&lt; 7%.<br />
□ Support SLAs achieved for 30 days; knowledge base completion ≥
90%.<br />
□ Incident drill passed: checkout failover, tax outage, and moderation
surge.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• GM (city) — owns go/no‑go and stakeholder comms.<br />
• Product leads — own feature flags and acceptance criteria.<br />
• Trust lead — owns safety SLAs and appeals.<br />
• Finance lead — owns daily close, payouts, tax receipts.<br />
• SRE — owns SLOs, incident drills, and rollback tests.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• Alpha and Beta dashboards with S→I, I→B, GMV, payout latency, dispute
rates, moderation SLAs.<br />
• Error budgets per surface (search, messaging, checkout): burn tracked
in weekly business review.<br />
• Flag registry with owners, blast radii, city gates, and rollback
steps; last‑tested timestamp.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Soft launches slip into GA without readiness → enforce hard gates and
require sign‑off from Trust and Finance.<br />
• Admin gaps force engineering ops → refuse GA until support can act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ All GA gates green for 14 consecutive days.<br />
✓ No Sev‑0s in last 14 days; Sev‑1 MTTR within target; drill passed in
last 30 days.<br />
✓ Help‑center content audited; macros cover top 20 issues.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Moderation backlog at Beta:<br />
Trigger: Unreviewed queue &gt; threshold for &gt;6 hours<br />
Response: Enable stricter Safe‑Mode; deploy extra moderators; add queue
limits; tune classifier thresholds.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Return thresholds; publish learnings; adjust appeals
capacity.<br />
Owner: Trust lead | Telemetry: queue_length, SLA breach count, appeal
rate | User Copy: “We’re reviewing more submissions than usual. Uploads
remain safe but may take longer to appear.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Checkout latency spike:<br />
Trigger: p95 &gt; target; timeouts increasing<br />
Response: Scale workers; rate‑limit promos; prioritize ACH calls; turn
off non‑critical services via flags.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore gradually; compare error budget burn.<br />
Owner: SRE | Telemetry: p95_checkout, error_rate, SLO burn | User Copy:
“Brief delay processing payments; your card will not be charged
twice.”</p>

<p>§10.1 — City Turn‑Up Runbook (Supply Seeding, Perks, Pricing
Floors)</p>
<p>§10.1 — City Turn‑Up Runbook (Supply Seeding, Perks, Pricing
Floors)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Stand up a new city with sufficient verified supply and early demand
to avoid empty results.<br />
• Deploy time‑boxed perks and CPC floors matched to local liquidity
without rigging ranking.<br />
• Ship the same playbook predictably: verify, seed, promote, measure,
iterate.</p>
<p>Pre‑turn‑up (T‑30 → T‑7):<br />
□ Studio partners: 10–20 verified studios; deposit defaults configured;
house rules imported.<br />
□ Supply: 300+ ID‑verified providers across roles; 50 Trusted Pro;
balanced gender and specialties.<br />
□ Demand: 1,000+ waitlisted buyers; 50+ brand/agency leads; outreach
sequences prepped.<br />
□ Pricing floors: local CPC floors for promotions set; featured carousel
plan.<br />
□ Help content: city‑specific FAQs; local safety resources; studio
access details.</p>
<p>Turn‑up week (T‑7 → T):<br />
□ Press/PR drop; city landing page live with featured
creators/studios.<br />
□ Founding city perks activated: 0% buyer fee first booking; –2%
provider fee for 60 days.<br />
□ Referral program switch‑on; invite codes distributed to partner
studios.<br />
□ Trust staffing extended for local hours; support macros localized.</p>
<p>Post‑turn‑up (T → T+30):<br />
□ Daily stand‑up with city metrics; tune CPC floors; adjust caps; rotate
Featured slots.<br />
□ Host creator meetup; collect content for home carousels; capture
testimonials.<br />
□ Activate RFP broadcast for brands; monitor response quality; adjust
threshold for eligibility.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• City GM — owns overall success, partners, PR.<br />
• Growth lead — owns perks, floors, featured slots.<br />
• Trust lead — owns moderation and safety SLAs in city hours.<br />
• Support lead — owns macro correctness and queue staffing.<br />
• Studios PM — owns deposit &amp; rules configuration.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• City‑level S→I, I→B, GMV, active providers/buyers; promotions adoption
&amp; ROAS; studio attach rate.<br />
• Supply heatmap: coverage by neighborhood; search 'no results' rate;
bounce rate for first‑time visitors.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Thin supply pockets → targeted invites; perks for under‑represented
niches; flexible radius defaults.<br />
• PR blowback on nudity policy → artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode
defaults; trained press responses.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Sufficient supply (≥300 ID‑verified) and demand (≥1,000 waitlist) in
place.<br />
✓ Support and Trust staffing schedules confirmed for local hours.<br />
✓ Perks, floors, and featured modules toggled and measured with
caps.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Uneven neighborhood coverage:<br />
Trigger: Searches returning &lt;10 results in key districts<br />
Response: Targeted outreach and incentives; Featured rotation weight to
uncovered areas.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Normalize rotation once coverage improves.<br />
Owner: City GM | Telemetry: no_results_rate, results_count_by_zip | User
Copy: “We’re expanding coverage in your area—new creators arriving
daily.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Featured slots underperform:<br />
Trigger: CTR &lt; target for 3 days<br />
Response: Swap creatives (portfolio picks), adjust slot order, test copy
on ribbons.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore prior set if CTR worsens.<br />
Owner: Growth | Telemetry: featured_impr, featured_ctr,
inquiries_from_featured | User Copy: N/A (UI visual only)</p>

<p>§10.2 — Safety &amp; Trust Launch Checklist (IDV/BG Readiness,
Moderation SLAs)</p>
<p>§10.2 — Safety &amp; Trust Launch Checklist (IDV/BG Readiness,
Moderation SLAs)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Ensure safety systems are ready and staffed before public
exposure.<br />
• Align ID verification, background checks, Safe‑Mode, and moderation to
city‑specific risk patterns.<br />
• Document adverse‑action and appeals so decisions are consistent and
defensible.</p>
<p>ID Verification (IDV):<br />
□ Vendor SLA tested; fallback flow documented; fraud heuristics tuned
for local IDs.<br />
□ Eligibility rules: Instant Book gated by IDV; Verified‑only search
filter returns correct results.<br />
□ Privacy: PII vault operational; admin masked views; access logs
audited.</p>
<p>Background Checks (Trusted Pro):<br />
□ Consent screens live; pre‑adverse/adverse templates localized; waiting
periods per FCRA.<br />
□ Badge logic integrated with search ranking tie‑break and provider fee
nudge (where applicable).<br />
□ Subsidy program configured for first cohort; budget caps set.</p>
<p>Moderation &amp; Safe‑Mode:<br />
□ Classifier thresholds tuned; artistic‑only examples published; appeals
workflow tested.<br />
□ Queue staffing plan with on‑call escalation; SLA dashboards live;
content templates stocked.<br />
□ Harassment/doXXing macros; emergency law‑enforcement flow
rehearsed.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• Trust lead — overall safety posture; moderation and appeals.<br />
• Legal — FCRA compliance; policy approval.<br />
• Data — classifier thresholds; safety telemetry.<br />
• Support — macro training; triage playbooks.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• Moderation SLA (time to action), appeal reversal rate, report rate per
1,000 legs, IB suppression count.<br />
• IDV completion rate; Trusted Pro adoption; safety incidents trend.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Over‑moderation → creator churn; mitigate with clear examples and
appeals.<br />
• Under‑moderation → safety risk; mitigate with queue staffing and
thresholds.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Moderation SLA met in dry runs; appeal path validated.<br />
✓ IDV flows stable; Trusted Pro notices correct; badge logic live.<br />
✓ Safe‑Mode default for guests verified; examples page published.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — IDV vendor latency:<br />
Trigger: p95 &gt; threshold<br />
Response: Switch to fallback; queue retries; inform users; prioritize
Instant Book candidates.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal when SLA restored.<br />
Owner: Trust | Telemetry: idv_latency, idv_failure_rate | User Copy:
“Identity checks are taking longer than usual. Your verification will
complete shortly.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Harassment spike after PR:<br />
Trigger: Reports &gt; baseline × 3<br />
Response: Triage macros; temporary rate limits; visible enforcement on
egregious cases.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Lift limits after sustained normal levels.<br />
Owner: Trust/Support | Telemetry: report_rate, action_SLA | User Copy:
“We’re actively addressing increased reports. Thanks for your
patience.”</p>

<p>§10.3 — Payments &amp; Tax Go‑Live Checklist (Test Plans &amp;
Contingency)</p>
<p>§10.3 — Payments &amp; Tax Go‑Live Checklist (Test Plans &amp;
Contingency)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Prove money moves correctly before opening the floodgates.<br />
• Keep contingency playbooks for processor or tax engine
incidents.<br />
• Ensure receipts, payouts, and reconciliations are audit‑ready.</p>
<p>Processor Readiness:<br />
□ Card: auth, capture, partial refund, full refund, dispute webhook; 3DS
challenge test; card update flows.<br />
□ ACH: link, micro‑deposit fallback, return codes, buyer fee reduction,
retry logic.<br />
□ Payouts: bank connect, reserve holds, Early Payout per‑use, failed
payout retry.</p>
<p>Tax Engine Readiness:<br />
□ Quotes by state allowlist; latency SLO met; credit memos for refunds;
outage banner fallback.<br />
□ Receipts: itemized tax per leg; deposit auth not taxed; captured
deposit taxed as required.</p>
<p>Reconciliation:<br />
□ Daily close: match processor settlements; promotions wallet charges;
tax exports; variance alarms.<br />
□ Admin tools: amended receipts; ledger views; chargeback kit
templates.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• Finance lead — reconciliation and receipts.<br />
• Payments PM/Eng — processor integration and webhooks.<br />
• Tax PM — engine configuration and allowlists.<br />
• Support — money macros; dispute intake.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• Checkout success rate; tax quote success/latency; payout latency;
settlement variance; chargeback win rate.<br />
• ACH adoption and effect on buyer fee vs processor cost.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Processor outage → ACH/card fallback; queue and retry; disable promos
if needed to protect performance.<br />
• Tax miscalculation → disable tax in affected state via allowlist;
message users; reconcile nightly.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ 14 consecutive days of green daily close; variance within
tolerance.<br />
✓ End‑to‑end test scenarios pass for both legs (talent and studio when
enabled).<br />
✓ Chargeback kit demonstrably complete; templates published.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Tax engine partial outage:<br />
Trigger: Quote failures &gt; threshold<br />
Response: Enable allowlist bypass for affected states; banner copy at
checkout; capture order with pending tax.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑quote and amend receipts post‑outage; notify
users.<br />
Owner: Tax PM | Telemetry: tax_quote_latency, tax_quote_error_rate |
User Copy: “We’re calculating taxes after checkout due to a temporary
issue—you’ll receive an updated receipt.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Payout queue stuck:<br />
Trigger: No payouts 'Sent' in last 2 hours with pending items<br />
Response: Pause new payouts; investigate webhook backlog; trigger manual
retries; communicate on payouts page.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Resume queue; audit duplicate guards.<br />
Owner: Payments Eng | Telemetry: payout_status_counts, webhook_lag |
User Copy: “Your payout is delayed while we process a queue issue. No
action is required.”</p>

<p>§10.4 — Support Readiness (Macros, Refund Calculators, SLAs)</p>
<p>§10.4 — Support Readiness (Macros, Refund Calculators, SLAs)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Equip Support to resolve the majority of issues without
engineering.<br />
• Publish macros, calculators, and knowledge so outcomes are consistent
and fast.<br />
• Measure and staff to SLAs that match city hours and expected
volume.</p>
<p>Tooling &amp; Macros:<br />
□ Refund calculator integrated; partial and multi‑leg support; time‑band
logic.<br />
□ Dispute intake wizard; chargeback evidence builder; attachment
checklist.<br />
□ Moderation escalation buttons; PII redaction; account limits
controls.<br />
□ DM limits and spam controls; identity re‑verification triggers.</p>
<p>Knowledge Base:<br />
□ Top 50 issues covered; plain‑English answers; screenshots of admin
steps.<br />
□ Money articles: refunds, tax, deposits, chargebacks; trust articles:
Safe‑Mode, IDV, BG.<br />
□ City‑specific FAQs: perks, studios, accessibility info.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; SLAs:<br />
□ Queue size forecasts; shifts aligned to city hours; escalation paths
to Trust/Finance.<br />
□ FRT/FRR targets by priority; on‑call coverage for incidents; training
completion records.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• Support lead — macros, staffing, training.<br />
• Trust liaison — safety escalations and training.<br />
• Finance liaison — money macros and approvals.<br />
• Product — admin feature readiness and gaps.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• FRT/FRR; reopen rate; macro usage rate; CSAT; SLA breaches; ticket
categories and trends.<br />
• Deflection: % resolved via knowledge base before ticket creation.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Under‑tooled support → backlog and inconsistent outcomes; mitigate
with calculators and macros.<br />
• Over‑escalation → engineer toil; mitigate with clear paths and admin
powers.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Macros published and versioned; refund calculator validated with
finance; training complete.<br />
✓ SLAs met during dry run; escalation and paging tested; knowledge base
&gt;90% coverage of top issues.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Refund volume spike:<br />
Trigger: Refund tickets &gt; baseline × 2<br />
Response: Enable queue filters; adjust macros; preemptive emails for
known issues; expand staffing windows.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to standard macros; retrospective root cause
analysis.<br />
Owner: Support lead | Telemetry: refund_ticket_rate, SLA_breaches | User
Copy: “We’ve received your refund request and are prioritizing it.
Expect an update soon.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Spam wave in DMs:<br />
Trigger: New‑conversation sends with low response rate spike<br />
Response: Tighten rate limits; require IDV for new outreach; update
abuse heuristics; temporary DM credit freeze.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Gradual relaxation with monitors.<br />
Owner: Trust liaison | Telemetry: dm_send_rate, spam_reports | User
Copy: “We’re limiting new messages briefly to reduce spam while
maintaining creator safety.”</p>

• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.<br />
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases

• Holdouts &amp; Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic
nudges run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.<br />
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie

<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Launch paid visibility without harming search relevance or
trust.<br />
• Prove ROAS with holdouts; keep density and frequency caps
enforced.<br />
• Give providers clear setup, reporting, and refunds for invalid
clicks.</p>
<p>Pre‑launch:<br />
□ Eligibility gates (IDV, Rep ≥ 70, no strikes) enforced; QS formula
tuned; CPC floors by role/city set.<br />
□ Density caps: ≤2 boosted in top‑20; ≤1 above the fold; frequency caps
per buyer/session/day.<br />
□ Holdout cells configured (5–10%); dashboards wired; invalid‑click
detection live with auto‑crediting.</p>
<p>Provider UX:<br />
□ Boost setup wizard; suggested bid range; estimated clicks; QS
improvement checklist.<br />
□ Reporting: impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, inquiries, bookings, GMV,
ROAS; alerts for budget depletion and invalid clicks.</p>
<p>QA &amp; Monitoring:<br />
□ End‑to‑end click tracking; fraud heuristics test; miscategorization
auto‑pause; city ops pricing governance.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• Growth PM — product settings and UX.<br />
• Trust — eligibility and abuse handling.<br />
• Finance — revenue recognition; invalid‑click credits accounting.<br />
• City Ops — floors and featured pricing per city.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• CPC, CTR, QS distribution; ROAS median; invalid‑click credit %; buyer
hide/report on promoted cards.<br />
• Organic search KPIs unaffected: S→I, I→B, satisfaction; measure
cannibalization risk.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Pay‑to‑win perception → strong labeling, relevance match, caps;
eligibility bars.<br />
• Fraud → auto‑credits; throttle offenders; anomaly alerts; manual
review for patterns.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Holdout ROAS ≥ 2.5× median; invalid‑click credits &lt; 7%; organic
KPIs stable within guardrails.<br />
✓ Provider setup and reporting successful in dry run; billing via wallet
correct.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Invalid clicks surge:<br />
Trigger: Invalid rate &gt; upper bound<br />
Response: Tighten fraud filters; auto‑credit; temporarily reduce
density; notify affected providers.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Relax once normal; publish learning.<br />
Owner: Growth/Trust | Telemetry: invalid_click_rate, ROAS | User Copy:
“We issued credits for suspicious clicks while we improve
detection—thanks for your patience.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Provider backlash on labeling:<br />
Trigger: Feedback cites confusion or distrust<br />
Response: Improve 'Promoted' tooltip; publish help page; survey to
validate clarity.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: A/B previous label copy if metrics regress.<br />
Owner: Growth PM | Telemetry: buyer_hide_rate, help_center_views | User
Copy: “Promoted results match your filters and are clearly marked to
keep search fair.”</p>

<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an

and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Coordinate launch communications that set correct expectations, drive
adoption, and reduce support burden.<br />
• Use lifecycle sequences for providers and buyers tied to real
behaviors.<br />
• Keep help‑center content synchronized with UI and policy changes.</p>
<p>Provider lifecycle (examples):<br />
□ Welcome (IDV + how to publish first package).<br />
□ First inquiry → 'How to convert to booking' tips.<br />
□ First booking → 'Deliverables manifest &amp; acceptance'
checklist.<br />
□ Trusted Pro pass → badge benefits + Boost coupon.<br />
□ Churn risk → nudge with availability tips and price guidance.</p>
<p>Buyer lifecycle (examples):<br />
□ Welcome → search tips + Safe‑Mode explainer.<br />
□ First booking → 'What to expect' and refund windows; ACH discount
callout.<br />
□ Post‑booking → review request; referral invite.<br />
□ RFP broadcasts → 'How to write a brief' guide.</p>
<p>Help‑center &amp; status updates:<br />
□ Visual examples for artistic‑only boundaries; Safe‑Mode toggle
guide.<br />
□ Tax and money articles; city perks pages; studio deposit
explanations.<br />
□ Status page for incidents; templates for banners and in‑app
notices.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• Marketing — sequences and brand voice.<br />
• Product — in‑app copy and help‑center alignment.<br />
• Support — macros and FAQ freshness; deflection tracking.<br />
• Trust — safety copy and escalation comms.<br />
• Finance — money/tax copy accuracy.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• Open/click rates; conversions from emails; deflection %; NPS changes;
complaint rates; unsubscribes.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Over‑emailing → unsubscribes; mitigate with behavior‑based triggers
and caps.<br />
• Policy confusion → keep examples fresh and visible; avoid
legalese.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ All core sequences QA’d; help‑center synchronized with UI; status page
playbooks ready.<br />
✓ Comms calendar coordinated with city turn‑ups and feature flags.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Press spike:<br />
Trigger: Traffic surge and PR mentions<br />
Response: Pin welcome and safety posts; adjust sequences to onboard
quickly; ensure support has pinned macros.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Return to normal cadence.<br />
Owner: Marketing/Product | Telemetry: bounce_rate, activation_rate |
User Copy: “New here? Start with how booking works in 3 steps.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Email deliverability dip:<br />
Trigger: Inbox placement declines<br />
Response: Warmup IPs; prune lists; adjust sending windows; improve
DKIM/SPF; diversify to in‑app and SMS for critical comms.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Reintroduce segments gradually.<br />
Owner: Marketing | Telemetry: bounce/complaint rates | User Copy: N/A
(backend deliverability)</p>

<p>§10.7 — Incident Command &amp; Rollback Drills (Feature‑Flag
Recipes)</p>
<p>§10.7 — Incident Command &amp; Rollback Drills (Feature‑Flag
Recipes)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an
artistic‑only boundary with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables
are handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests.
Instant Book requires ID verification; background checks are opt‑in
(Trusted Pro). Payments include card (3DS when required) and ACH (with a
reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Establish an incident framework with clear roles, SEV levels, and
rollback powers.<br />
• Practice drills that reflect our highest‑risk surfaces: checkout, tax,
moderation, promotions.<br />
• Document feature‑flag recipes that safely degrade functionality.</p>
<p>Roles &amp; SEV:<br />
□ Incident Commander (IC) + Comms + Ops + Eng; SEV‑0/1/2 matrix with
SLAs.<br />
□ Pager rotations; escalation tree; status page policies; customer comms
templates.</p>
<p>Flag recipes:<br />
□ Disable promotions; reduce density to zero; keep organic ranking
intact.<br />
□ Checkout degrade: force card when ACH engine degraded; allow 'pending
tax' path with banner.<br />
□ Safe‑Mode hardening: increase thresholds; pause new media ingestion;
keep messaging live.<br />
□ Admin controls: kill‑switches for money moves require two‑person
approval.</p>
<p>Drills:<br />
□ Quarterly disaster day with switchbacks; capture MTTA/MTTR;
retrospective with action items.<br />
□ Vendor outage simulations: processor, tax, IDV; confirm
fallbacks.<br />
□ Data corruption simulation: DQ gates trigger; freeze dashboards;
recover from backups.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• SRE/Platform — incident framework and drills.<br />
• Product leads — flag recipes and blast radii.<br />
• Trust/Finance — guardrails for money/safety degradations.<br />
• Support — comms and macros.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• MTTA/MTTR; incidents by SEV; error budget burn; flags toggled; status
page updates; support volume surge and SLA.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Unclear authority in crisis → written runbooks; regular
practice.<br />
• Regression after rollback → smoke tests; post‑incident QA; changelog
discipline.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ At least one multi‑surface drill passed per quarter.<br />
✓ All flag recipes tested in sandbox and once in production under
controlled conditions.<br />
✓ Status page and comms templates verified; on‑call schedules
posted.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Processor partial outage:<br />
Trigger: Spike in card declines; webhook lag<br />
Response: Prefer ACH; pause promotions; display safe banner; queue
retries; coordinate with processor.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Enable normal flows gradually; audit
duplicates.<br />
Owner: SRE/Payments | Telemetry: decline_rate, webhook_lag | User Copy:
“Some card payments are impacted—try ACH or retry shortly.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Moderation surge from viral post:<br />
Trigger: Queue length &gt; threshold<br />
Response: Tighten Safe‑Mode; pause new media; reassign staff; inform
users.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Reopen after backlog clears.<br />
Owner: Trust | Telemetry: queue_length, SLA | User Copy: “We’re
reviewing more uploads than usual; thanks for your patience.”</p>

<p>§10.8 — Post‑Launch Review Template (7/30/90‑Day)</p>
<p>Operational Disclaimer: This playbook bundle is an internal execution
guide. It is not a public policy document. Where compliance or legal
actions are required, consult Section 8 and counsel. Where money flows
change, consult Sections 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: Our launch approach is city‑by‑city with
nationwide signups allowed, starting in Houston. We launch
subscription‑free, monetize through take‑rate and usage‑based promotions
with strict eligibility and caps, and keep public media within an

reduced buyer fee). Feature flags and city gates control blast radius,
and the Admin Console enables Support, Trust, Finance, and Ops to act
without code changes.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Turn launch learnings into process and product improvements
quickly.<br />
• Hold owners accountable for outcomes with clear metrics and action
items.<br />
• Decide whether to expand to the next city based on evidence.</p>
<p>7‑Day Review:<br />
□ Adoption: active providers/buyers vs targets; first‑booking rates;
activation funnels.<br />
□ Trust: report rate; moderation SLA; IDV adoption; early safety
incidents.<br />
□ Money: checkout success; payout latency; daily close; tax
reconciliation.<br />
□ Support: FRT/FRR; top tickets; macro gaps.<br />
□ Promotions (if on): adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credits.</p>
<p>30‑Day Review:<br />
□ Conversion: S→I and I→B trends; repeat bookings; cancellations and
reasons.<br />
□ Economics: take‑rate mix; processor costs; promotions contribution;
COGS vs plan.<br />
□ Quality: dispute loss rate; review sentiment; reputation score
distribution.<br />
□ Ops: staffing vs SLA; incident count; flag drift; help‑center
coverage.</p>
<p>90‑Day Review:<br />
□ Cohort retention curves; contribution margin; CAC payback in city;
referrals and organic loops.<br />
□ Safety stability; appeals accuracy; Trusted Pro share; studios attach
and deposit claims.<br />
□ Decision: scale promotions floors? Open nearby city? Adjust perks?</p>
<p>Owners &amp; Roles:<br />
• City GM — overall; compile review.<br />
• Product &amp; Data — KPIs and analysis.<br />
• Trust &amp; Support — safety and ops analysis.<br />
• Finance — economics and close; tax reconciliation.<br />
• Growth — promotions and CAC payback.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; Readiness Signals:<br />
• Dashboards per §5; appendix with definitions; DQ report; cohort
charts; incident summaries.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Celebratory bias → insist on counter‑metrics; include 'what went
wrong' section.<br />
• Action‑less reviews → require named owners and due dates for every
item.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Action plan approved with owners and deadlines for the next 30
days.<br />
✓ Decision recorded on city expansion or adjustments to
floors/perks/promotions.<br />
✓ Review doc archived with links to dashboards, audits, and incident
reports.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Dispute loss rate out of bounds:<br />
Trigger: Loss rate &gt; target for 2 months<br />
Response: Tighten SOW defaults; improve manifest guidance; enhance
chargeback kits; educate users with comms.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑evaluate after 30 days; iterate solutions.<br />
Owner: Finance/Product | Telemetry: dispute_loss_rate, refund_rate |
User Copy: “We’ve clarified deliverables and refunds to reduce
misunderstandings.”</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Promotions ROAS under target:<br />
Trigger: ROAS median &lt; 2.5×<br />
Response: Adjust QS weights; lower density; improve provider guidance;
test floors; pause low‑quality cohorts.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore after lift.<br />
Owner: Growth | Telemetry: ROAS_distribution, QS | User Copy: “Tips to
improve your boost performance are now in your dashboard.”</p>

• Help‑Center Alignment: All user‑facing copy is mirrored in the help
center with last‑updated dates and visual examples. We avoid legal
jargon; we explain outcomes and next steps.<br />
• QA Strategy: We prefer production‑like staging with seeded data and
synthetic bookings. We test under simulated load, outage, and edge cases
(ACH returns, 3DS failures, moderation queue spikes).<br />
• Holdouts &amp; Experiments: Promotions, ranking, and any economic
nudges run with control cells and pre‑registered guardrails. We pause
experiments when guardrails breach.<br />
• Close‑the‑Loop: Post‑launch, we hold 7/30/90‑day reviews that tie
metrics to actions and retire ineffective steps.</p>

<p>Section 11 — Risk Register &amp; Mitigations (11.0–11.8)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:18:34 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section below is a detailed risk blueprint (≥2,500 words)
aligned to Sections 1–10.</p>
<p>§11.0 — Risk Taxonomy, Scoring &amp; Governance (Likelihood × Impact,
RPN, Ownership)</p>
<p>§11.0 — Risk Taxonomy, Scoring &amp; Governance (Likelihood × Impact,
RPN, Ownership)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Create a shared language for risk across product, trust, finance,
legal, and ops.<br />
• Standardize scoring (likelihood × impact) and prioritization (RPN) to
focus on material risks.<br />
• Define ownership, cadence, and escalation paths; integrate with flags
and city gates.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Mis‑moderation or unclear public‑content boundaries leading to
press/regulatory risk.<br />
• Payments outage or mis‑settlement leading to user harm and trust
loss.<br />
• Chargeback/fraud ring increasing losses and throttling growth.<br />
• PII exposure or vendor breach causing legal and reputational
damage.<br />
• Tax miscollection due to misclassification or engine errors causing
financial exposure.<br />
• Operational overload (support/trust) at launch reducing quality and
SLAs.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Ambiguous policy or incomplete training; lack of examples in
§8.2.<br />
• Insufficient end‑to‑end money testing; single processor
dependency.<br />
• Weak off‑platform leakage controls; lack of buyer education at
checkout.<br />
• Over‑privileged admin roles; missing JIT elevation; vendor
misconfigurations.<br />
• Incorrect item mappings in tax engine; gaps in allowlist
rollout.<br />
• Underestimated volume; insufficient macros; incomplete admin
tools.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• Spike in appeals overturning moderation decisions; media mentions with
negative framing.<br />
• Checkout p95 latency and error spikes; rise in payout 'failed'
states.<br />
• Chargeback rate &gt; baseline; clustering by BIN/issuer or
geography.<br />
• Admin PII unmask spikes; vendor SOC/pentest exceptions; unusual export
volumes.<br />
• Reconciliation variances by state; tax quote error rates; support
tickets citing tax confusion.<br />
• SLA breaches in Support/Trust; increased reopen rates; macro usage
slump.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Publish examples and Safe‑Mode defaults; require two‑person review for
edge policies.<br />
• Multi‑processor readiness; drills; ACH fallback and banners.<br />
• In‑chat off‑platform warnings; escrow value copy; IB incentives for
verified users.<br />
• RBAC, JIT elevation, two‑person approvals; vendor due diligence; PII
vault.<br />
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliations; receipt itemization
tests.<br />
• Staffing buffers; calculators/macros; deflection via help‑center;
admin operability gates.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Moderation surge → raise Safe‑Mode thresholds; add moderators; publish
guidance.<br />
• Processor incident → switch rails; queue retries; pause promotions;
status page updates.<br />
• Fraud ring → tighten DM limits; require IDV; suppress Instant Book;
manual review.<br />
• PII incident → incident command; containment; counsel; notifications;
post‑mortem.<br />
• Tax outage → allowlist bypass; pending tax receipts; reconciliation
corrections.<br />
• Support overload → triage macros; priority queues; temporary hours
extension; surge staffing.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Risk DRI (cross‑functional), City GM, Trust Lead, Payments PM, Tax PM,
SRE, Support Lead, Legal.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Risk Priority Number (RPN) tallied monthly; top‑10 risks reviewed in
exec meeting.<br />
• Time to mitigation for red risks; number of incidents by SEV; audit
action completion rate.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Any red risk (RPN ≥ 16 on 1–5×1–5 with impact weighted) triggers
weekly review and action plan.<br />
• Two consecutive months with rising RPN in the same category triggers
board visibility.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• Section 5 dashboards; Section 8 policies; Section 10 incident drills;
Admin §4.14 tooling.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Risk register live with owners; reviewed monthly; versioned.<br />
□ Scoring rubric published; examples for each score; training
completed.<br />
□ Top‑10 risks have explicit mitigations, flags, and playbooks.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Conflicting risk mitigations:<br />
Context: A mitigation for promotions harms search fairness KPIs.<br />
Trigger: Organic S→I drops &gt; 10% after promotions tweak.<br />
Immediate actions: Revert via flag; expand holdout; convene
cross‑functional review; adjust QS weight.<br />
Communication: Internal only; no user comms unless visible changes
persist.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Restore prior QS; publish learnings in registry.<br />
Owner: Growth + Product | Telemetry: S→I, buyer hide/report rates, ROAS
| Evidence: A/B logs; click maps; holdout diffs</p>
<p>Execution Notes:<br />
• Every risk has a dashboard tile with an owner, a definition of the
denominator, and a weekly narrative. • Risk reviews pair with §10
post‑launch 7/30/90‑day reviews and §8 compliance calendar. • Where a
risk spans multiple squads, the city GM or Risk DRI chairs the review;
actions have due dates. • We prefer reversible changes (flags) and
narrow blast radius (city gates). • We avoid 'security by obscurity'; we
publish clear user guidance, train staff, and keep audit trails for all
sensitive actions. • The risk register itself is versioned; changes
record rationale and observed metrics.</p>

<p>§11.1 — Product &amp; UX Risks (Adoption, Clarity, Multi‑Role
Complexity, Deliverables)</p>
<p>§11.1 — Product &amp; UX Risks (Adoption, Clarity, Multi‑Role
Complexity, Deliverables)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Identify user‑experience pitfalls that slow adoption or create
confusion.<br />
• Ensure multi‑role profiles, search filters, and booking flows remain
clear and fast.<br />
• Prevent scope creep and feature load that harms initial
simplicity.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Multi‑role profile confusion causes poor discovery and low
conversion.<br />
• Over‑complex search overwhelms new buyers; defaults hide relevant
results.<br />
• Deliverables manifest flow is too heavy, causing drop‑offs and
disputes later.<br />
• Reschedule/Change Order UX leads to off‑platform renegotiations and
leakage.<br />
• Boards/following become noisy; feed devolves into spam; DM fatigue
increases.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Insufficient labeling between roles; poor tabbing; mixed reviews
across roles.<br />
• Too many filters surfaced by default; lack of presets; unclear
tooltips.<br />
• Manifest requirements unclear; large file flows intimidating; external
links not well explained.<br />
• Change fees and time bands not visible; provider controls not
transparent.<br />
• No rate limits; weak relevance; missing foldering and muting
controls.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• High bounce on profile tabs; low click‑through to booking from role
pages.<br />
• Filter usage spikes with declining S→I; help‑center views for 'how to
search'.<br />
• Abandoned 'Add deliverables' step; disputes citing 'not as
described'.<br />
• Change orders initiated off‑platform; refund tickets citing
confusion.<br />
• Hide/mute rates; follow churn; DM response time increases; spam
reports.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Clear role tabs, separate reviews per role, cross‑linking;
role‑specific landing pages.<br />
• Beginner mode with presets; advanced filter drawer; definitions chips;
engagement sliders.<br />
• Lightweight manifest defaults + 'external link manifest' explainer;
examples and templates.<br />
• Inline price math; protected change order flow; audit trail; lock
messaging until accepted.<br />
• Foldered follows; rate limits; mute; relevance tuning; 'quality bar'
for feed posts.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Search simplification AB test; remove low‑value filters; increase
presets.<br />
• Deliverables tutorial video; acceptance window guidance; macro for
'how manifests work'.<br />
• DM spam spike: tighten sends; require IDV for outreach; adjust credits
per §3.2 launch spec.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Product (Profiles/Search/Booking), Design, Data, Trust liaison,
Support.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• S→I and I→B per role; click‑through from tabs; change order
on‑platform rate vs off‑platform signals.<br />
• Dispute rate 'not as described'; manifest completion rate; feed
engagement health.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Drop in S→I &gt; 10% over 7 days; feed hide rate &gt; threshold;
off‑platform signals increase.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• Role‑aware profiles (§1.1), search filters (§1.2), deliverables
(§3.6), messaging (§1.4), analytics (§1.6).</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Role tabs and separate reviews confirmed; presets live; tooltips
tested with users.<br />
□ Change order UX integrated; macros and help content published;
telemetry validated.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Search paralysis:<br />
Context: Buyers apply too many filters, zero results.<br />
Trigger: No‑results rate up in key cohorts.<br />
Immediate actions: Suggest relaxations; show 'near matches'; auto‑save
boards for later.<br />
Communication: In‑UI nudges; help article link.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Restore stricter defaults if irrelevant results
rise.<br />
Owner: Search PM | Telemetry: no_results_rate, CTR | Evidence: Filter
combinations; session replays (privacy‑safe)</p>

<p>§11.2 — Trust &amp; Safety Risks (Harassment, Impersonation,
Off‑Platform Harm, Policy Drift)</p>
<p>§11.2 — Trust &amp; Safety Risks (Harassment, Impersonation,
Off‑Platform Harm, Policy Drift)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Reduce likelihood and impact of safety incidents involving harassment,
doxxing, impersonation, or off‑platform harm.<br />
• Keep public content within artistic‑only boundaries; maintain
Safe‑Mode defaults for guests.<br />
• Ensure consistent moderation with appeals and examples to avoid
drift.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Harassment/doxxing in DMs or feeds leading to user harm and PR
blowback.<br />
• Impersonation or fake profiles enabling scams or unsafe
bookings.<br />
• Underage appearance risk; failure to detect minors in media or
accounts.<br />
• Policy drift causing inconsistent enforcement across cities and
moderators.<br />
• Off‑platform incidents tied to bookings (safety at shoots).</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Insufficient rate limits, weak report tools; unclear
consequences.<br />
• Weak IDV adoption; lax selfie‑to‑ID checks; stock images in
profiles.<br />
• Lack of classifier support; no birthdate consistency checks.<br />
• Inadequate training; missing examples; subjective decisions without
guidance.<br />
• Poor venue controls; lack of trusted contact features; unclear house
rules.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• Spike in harassment reports; higher block rates; trending topics
calling out the platform.<br />
• Chargeback narratives citing impersonation; increased 'scam'
reports.<br />
• Reports about age; 'minor' flags from models; vendor alerts.<br />
• Appeal reversal rate high; inter‑moderator variance in similar
cases.<br />
• Safety reports post‑booking; law‑enforcement contacts; negative
reviews citing safety.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Stronger rate limits; spam heuristics; 'report &amp; block' prominent;
doxxing macro and removal.<br />
• IDV gate for Instant Book; selfie checks; image forensics on profile
media.<br />
• Age checks in onboarding; minors policy training; escalations to
T&amp;S lead.<br />
• Policy examples gallery; moderation calibration sessions; QA on
decisions.<br />
• Trusted contact links; area‑share during booking; studio verification;
house rules.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Harassment surge: rate limit new senders; lock threads pending review;
publish anti‑harassment stance.<br />
• Impersonation ring: mass review of recent signups; require IDV before
messaging; remove offenders.<br />
• Minor risk: freeze account; verify; remove media; contact authorities
if required.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Trust lead, Moderation team, Support, Legal liaison, Studios PM.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Harassment reports per 1,000 legs; appeal reversals; impersonation
takedowns; IDV adoption; safety incident rate.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Harassment ≥ threshold → enable stricter defaults; impersonation
cluster → require IDV for new DMs.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• Section 8 policies; §4.14 admin moderation tools; §1.5 signals; §3.4
verification monetization.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Calibrated examples live; moderation training complete; appeal SLAs
met; trusted contact &amp; area‑share live.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Coordinated harassment campaign:<br />
Context: External group targets creators after media coverage.<br />
Trigger: Reports ×3 baseline; social mentions spike.<br />
Immediate actions: Enable stricter DM limits; block repeat abusive
accounts; comms with safety tips; liaise with PR/legal.<br />
Communication: Status page + help‑center; direct messages to affected
users.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Return to normal limits when stable;
retrospective.<br />

<p>§11.3 — Payments, Tax &amp; Financial Risks (Processor, Chargebacks,
ACH, Tax Engine)</p>
<p>§11.3 — Payments, Tax &amp; Financial Risks (Processor, Chargebacks,
ACH, Tax Engine)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Protect cash flows with robust processor integrations, reserves, and
dispute playbooks.<br />
• Minimize tax exposure with allowlists and reconciliations; prevent
miscollection.<br />
• Keep promotions billing clean with invalid‑click credits and
audits.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Processor outage or webhook lag causes failed checkouts and delayed
payouts.<br />
• Chargebacks spike from 'services not rendered' claims; representment
fails.<br />
• ACH returns increase; buyer fee discount abused without actual
collection benefit.<br />
• Tax engine misclassification causes over/under‑collection;
reconciliation variance.<br />
• Promotions billing errors; invalid clicks; ROAS falls below
target.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Single‑threaded webhooks; lack of retries; no queue health
monitors.<br />
• Poor deliverables acceptance; unclear SOW; missing evidence
packaging.<br />
• Weak bank link verification; unclear ACH discount message.<br />
• Item category mapping errors; missing city allowlists; tax outage
without fallback.<br />
• Fraud schemes; mis‑targeted paid delivery; quality score
mis‑weights.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• Checkout success drop; payout 'queued' backlog; settlement variance
alarms.<br />
• Chargeback rate &gt; 0.6%; win rate declines; dispute reasons
cluster.<br />
• ACH return codes trend; buyer fee complaints; low ACH adoption despite
discount.<br />
• Tax quote latency/errors; support tickets on taxes; state variance in
reconciliation.<br />
• Invalid‑click credit rate &gt; 7%; buyer hide/report on promoted cards
rises.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Queueing with idempotency; retry workers; multiple processors
readiness; ACH fallback path.<br />
• Manifest and acceptance flows; chargeback kits; SOW templates; refund
calculators.<br />
• Strong onboarding for ACH; clear savings math; returns handling
macros.<br />
• Tax allowlist; pending‑tax banner; nightly reconciliation and credits
memos.<br />
• Eligibility gates; density caps; QS tuning; holdouts and
auto‑credits.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promotions; status banners;
drain queues post‑incident.<br />
• Chargeback wave: strengthen evidence; reach‑outs; review refund policy
adherence; coaching providers.<br />
• Tax outage: allowlist affected states; capture; amend later; user
notices.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, Growth (promotions), Support.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Checkout success; payout latency; chargeback win rate; ACH adoption;
tax variance; promotions ROAS.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Sev‑1 for checkout/payout; chargebacks &gt; threshold; tax errors &gt;
threshold; ROAS &lt; 2.5× median.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §4.12 payments/tax center; §5 telemetry; §10.3 drills; processor/tax
vendor SLAs.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Daily close green 14 days; chargeback kit quality audits ≥95%; tax
reconciliations tight; invalid‑click credits automated.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Chargeback ring:<br />
Context: Clustered BIN and IPs; services not rendered claims.<br />
Trigger: Chargeback rate spikes; win rate drops.<br />
Immediate actions: Flag accounts; require IDV; strengthen acceptance
gating; proactive provider coaching; notify processor risk team.<br />
Communication: Help‑center post on acceptance and deliverables; targeted
provider emails.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Relax after rate normalizes; keep monitoring for
recurrence.<br />
Owner: Finance/Payments | Telemetry: chargeback_rate, win_rate |
Evidence: Receipts, chats, SOW, manifest, acceptance timestamps</p>

Secrets)</p>
<p>§11.4 — Data &amp; Security Risks (PII, Admin Abuse, Vendor,
Secrets)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Protect user data through least‑privilege, strong auth, encryption,
and auditable admin actions.<br />
• Reduce vendor and supply‑chain risks with diligence and limited
scopes.<br />
• Prepare for incidents with clear roles, drills, and
communications.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• PII exposure (name, address, TIN) through misconfigured access or
export.<br />
• Admin account abuse or credentials compromise leading to unauthorized
actions.<br />
• Vendor breach affecting processors, tax, IDV, or e‑signature
data.<br />
• Secrets leakage (API keys) causing system compromise.<br />
• Insufficient logging and monitoring hindering incident response.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Missing RBAC/JIT; broad exports; unmasked PII in UI.<br />
• Weak 2FA; phishing; shared accounts; poor device hygiene.<br />
• Vendor lacks SOC/Pentest posture; over‑broad data sharing; missing
DPAs.<br />
• Keys in source; unmanaged vault; no rotation schedule.<br />
• Logs without context; missing audit trails; alert fatigue.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• Spike in PII unmask events; large exports; access from new geos.<br />
• SSO anomalies; failed 2FA; password resets; new device alerts.<br />
• Vendor incident notices; latency anomalies; unusual API error
patterns.<br />
• Code scans finding secrets; vault access anomalies; long‑lived
credentials.<br />
• Missing or failing alerts; gaps in audit logging; delayed incident
detection.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• RBAC with PII scopes; masked by default; export reasons; PII access
ledger (§4.14.1).<br />
• SSO + mandatory 2FA; device trust; phishing training; no shared
accounts; JIT elevation.<br />
• Vendor due diligence; DPAs; least‑data sharing; breach clauses;
offboarding checklist.<br />
• Secrets in vault; rotation; static code analysis; CI guards;
break‑glass procedures.<br />
• Centralized logging; audit immutability; tuned alerts; regular drills;
incident runbooks.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Privacy incident: contain; assess; notify per counsel; post‑mortem;
reinforce training.<br />
• Admin compromise: revoke sessions; rotate secrets; review actions;
force password + 2FA resets.<br />
• Vendor breach: disable integrations; evaluate blast radius;
communicate if impacted.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Security lead (or SRE), Data, Legal/Privacy, Product owners for admin
features.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• PII access ledger anomalies; secrets rotation adherence; vendor
attestations current; incident MTTA/MTTR; audit completeness.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Any confirmed PII exfiltration → Sev‑0; admin compromise → Sev‑1;
vendor breach → Sev‑1 with legal involvement.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §4.14.1 access governance; §5.12 observability; vendor SLAs; legal
counsel.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ RBAC live; PII masked; logs/audits immutable; drills completed; vendor
records current; secrets rotation schedule active.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Suspicious PII export:<br />
Context: Large CSV export by a new admin at odd hours.<br />
Trigger: Anomaly alert on export size/time.<br />
Immediate actions: Suspend token; interview admin; check purpose; delete
copies; rotate access; document.<br />
Communication: Internal only unless exposure confirmed; consult
counsel.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Restore access with tighter scopes; training
follow‑up.<br />
Owner: Security lead | Telemetry: audit_export_events, pii_unmask_events
| Evidence: Audit log, export file hash, device/IP</p>

<p>§11.5 — Legal &amp; Regulatory Risks (Content, FCRA, ADA,
Anti‑Discrimination, DMCA)</p>
<p>§11.5 — Legal &amp; Regulatory Risks (Content, FCRA, ADA,
Anti‑Discrimination, DMCA)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Reduce litigation and regulatory exposure through clear policies,
training, and admin tools.<br />
• Operate within US‑only scope with city‑gated rollouts and reversible
flags for policy shifts.<br />
• Handle notices (DMCA, subpoenas) and FCRA steps correctly.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Public content crosses into prohibited explicit territory; moderation
inconsistency.<br />
• FCRA missteps in background checks (missing notices/wait
periods).<br />
• ADA/accessibility gaps lead to complaints; insufficient
accommodations.<br />
• Anti‑discrimination violations in listings or conduct.<br />
• DMCA takedown process failures; repeat infringer policy gaps;
subpoenas mishandled.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Ambiguous examples; Safe‑Mode defaults unclear; edge cases (art vs
explicit).<br />
• Insufficient training; templates missing; vendor SLAs unclear.<br />
• Design system not audited; large regressions; insufficient QA.<br />
• Users write exclusionary criteria; support unsure how to
enforce.<br />
• Intake missing required elements; slow response; poor
documentation.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• Appeal reversals trend; inconsistent outcomes between
moderators.<br />
• Trusted Pro appeals citing notice issues; legal inquiries from
users.<br />
• Accessibility tickets; external complaints; screen‑reader bug
reports.<br />
• Reports of discriminatory language; negative social mentions.<br />
• Increased DMCA notices; repeat infringer counts; subpoena volume.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Examples gallery and Safe‑Mode; moderator calibration; appeals
workflow.<br />
• FCRA playbook with timers; pre‑adverse/adverse templates; vendor
integration tests.<br />
• WCAG 2.1 AA audit cadence; accessible components; accommodation
request flow.<br />
• Non‑discrimination policy; templates; education first then
enforcement.<br />
• DMCA agent; intake form; counter‑notice path; evidence storage; legal
review; subpoena intake process.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Edge content escalation to T&amp;S + counsel; apply consistent
actions; update examples page.<br />
• FCRA audit of recent cases; pause badge decisions until gaps fixed;
retrospective training.<br />
• Accessibility triage; roadmap patch; communicate timelines without
legal admissions.<br />
• Discrimination report: intake, evidence, proportionate action; publish
learnings (de‑identified).<br />
• DMCA/subpoena queue; timely responses; transparency reporting.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Legal, Trust, Design System, Support, Data (for audits).</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Moderation reversal rates; FCRA timing adherence; accessibility defect
backlog; discrimination reports; DMCA SLA adherence.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Any missed FCRA adverse action window → immediate audit; accessibility
Sev‑1 bug count &gt; threshold → freeze release until patched.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §8 policy docs; §4.14 admin tools; §10 drills; vendor contracts with
SLAs.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Public policy pages live; templates/flows tested; audits scheduled;
DMCA agent designated; subpoena process documented.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Accessibility complaint from major
creator:<br />
Context: High‑profile creator raises screen‑reader issues
publicly.<br />
Trigger: Social and support spikes.<br />
Immediate actions: Triage bugs; publish acknowledgment; offer direct
assistance; prioritize fixes; regression tests.<br />
Communication: Accessible statement and timeline; private
outreach.<br />
Rollback/Forward: None; incorporate feedback into design system.<br />
Owner: Design System + Product | Telemetry: accessibility_bug_count,
time_to_fix | Evidence: Bug tickets; repro steps; user feedback</p>

exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Ensure we have the people, training, and tools to meet SLAs without
burnout.<br />
• Prevent vendor surprises with clear SLAs, playbooks, and
backups.<br />
• Keep the help‑center and macros aligned with product changes.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Support/Trust overwhelmed at launch; SLAs missed; morale drops.<br />
• Knowledge base drift; macros out of date; inconsistent outcomes.<br />
• Vendor outages without fallbacks; misaligned SLAs; long recovery
times.<br />
• On‑call fatigue; unclear incident roles; slow MTTR.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Under‑forecasted volume; insufficient training; admin gaps.<br />
• Rapid product changes; copy not versioned; lack of ownership.<br />
• Vendor contracts weak; no status notifications; single points of
failure.<br />
• On‑call rotations too thin; no drills; tools missing.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• FRT/FRR breaches; reopen rates; CSAT drop; internal escalations
rise.<br />
• Macro usage declines; ticket notes reveal confusion; help‑center views
spike without resolution.<br />
• Vendor latency and error alerts; outage durations; manual overrides
used.<br />
• Incident count rises; MTTA/MTTR increases; paging fatigue reports.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Staffing buffers; surge plan; calculators/macros; admin tools; office
hours.<br />
• KB versioning; DRI for each macro; release notes to support; periodic
reviews.<br />
• Vendor SLAs; failover tests; status webhooks; backup vendors or
fallbacks.<br />
• On‑call training; incident roles; drills; better tooling for runbooks
and flags.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Support surge: triage queue; prioritize money/safety; extend hours;
auto‑responses for low severity.<br />
• Vendor outage: switch to fallback; communicate; reconcile later.<br />
• On‑call fatigue: add backup rotation; lighten non‑incident workload;
coaching.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Support lead, Trust lead, SRE, Vendor manager, Product ops.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• FRT/FRR; reopen; CSAT; staffing vs forecast; incident MTTR; vendor
uptime vs SLA.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Two weeks of SLA misses → staffing or scope change; vendor &lt; 99.9%
→ escalation per contract.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §4.14 admin tools; §10 launch plans; vendor contracts and status
hooks.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Staffing plan signed; training complete; KB and macros versioned;
vendor failover tested; on‑call schedule live.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Support backlog post‑PR:<br />
Context: Large spike in tickets after press coverage.<br />
Trigger: Backlog &gt; X for &gt; Y hours.<br />
Immediate actions: Enable deflection; reassign staff; extend hours;
templates for common issues; weekly town‑hall webinar.<br />
Communication: Queue position notices; honest timelines.<br />
Rollback/Forward: Back to standard hours; retro and staffing
adjustments.<br />
Owner: Support lead | Telemetry: queue_size, SLA_breaches | Evidence:
Ticket logs; macro usage</p>

<p>§11.7 — City Expansion &amp; Market Risks (Supply/Demand, PR,
Competition)</p>
<p>§11.7 — City Expansion &amp; Market Risks (Supply/Demand, PR,
Competition)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Scale city‑by‑city without diluting quality or overextending
resources.<br />
• Manage PR around artistic‑only policy while growing creator
adoption.<br />
• Anticipate competitor reactions and prepare counter‑moves.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Supply/demand imbalance leads to empty searches or low
conversion.<br />
• PR backlash on nudity policy; misunderstanding of
'artistic‑only'.<br />
• Competitor copying features or undercutting fees; paid poaching of
providers.<br />
• Local regulatory quirks (taxes, studio rules) slow rollouts.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Insufficient seeding; poor neighborhood coverage; mis‑set price
floors.<br />
• Ambiguous messaging; lack of examples; culture‑specific
sensitivities.<br />
• No loyalty perks; unclear value vs competitors; weak community.<br />
• Poor research; lack of local counsel; rushed enablement.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• No‑results rate; S→I and I→B by district; studio attach rate; waitlist
conversion.<br />
• Press mentions; help‑center views on policy; support tickets querying
policy.<br />
• Churn of top providers; promotions adoption dips; competitor ads
targeting users.<br />
• Tax exceptions; studio rejection due to rules; compliance tickets.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• City runbook (§10.1); targeted invites; featured carousels; perks;
RFPs.<br />
• Artistic‑only examples page; Safe‑Mode defaults; local creator
ambassadors.<br />
• Loyalty (verified boosts, fee discounts for Trusted Pro/Instant Book);
community events; ROAS‑proven promotions.<br />
• City allowlist; local counsel; studio verification; phased feature
enablement.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Thin supply: focus invites, perks; adjust floors; partner with
studios; PR push with ambassadors.<br />
• PR backlash: publish examples; enforce policy consistently; avoid
adversarial tone; spotlight safety.<br />
• Competitor move: emphasize escrow, contracts, trust signals, and
fairness of promotions; not a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• City GM, Growth, Trust, Legal, Studios PM.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• Coverage heatmaps; conversion by area; PR sentiment; share of wallet
among active providers; event attendance.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• City expansion blocked if conversion or safety below thresholds for 4
weeks.<br />
• PR negativity above threshold triggers comms and creator outreach
plan.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §2 GTM plan; §3 monetization; §4 studios; §10 city turn‑up; §8 legal
posture.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ City readiness gates passed; ambassador program staffed; press kit
updated; compliance checks cleared.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Competitor fee cut campaign:<br />
Context: Local competitor drops fees to poach providers.<br />
Trigger: Churn increases among top quartile.<br />
Immediate actions: Targeted outreach; highlight escrow/trust;
limited‑time boosts credits; emphasize earnings after fees.<br />
Communication: Personalized messages; city page explainer.<br />
Rollback/Forward: End credits after stabilization; measure sustainable
effect.<br />
Owner: Growth/GM | Telemetry: provider_churn, bookings_share | Evidence:
Exit surveys; earnings comparisons</p>

<p>§11.8 — Crisis Scenarios &amp; Cross‑Team Drills (Sev‑0/1, Public
Comms, Recovery)</p>
<p>§11.8 — Crisis Scenarios &amp; Cross‑Team Drills (Sev‑0/1, Public
Comms, Recovery)</p>
<p>Risk &amp; Process Disclaimer: This section is an internal
risk‑management blueprint. It does not constitute legal, tax, or
security advice. Coordinate with counsel and security leaders before
externalizing any policy or committing to obligations. All examples are
illustrative and must be adapted to the realities measured in Section 5
dashboards.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace launch;
subscription‑free start; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with strict eligibility and caps. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode defaults for guests. Deliverables are
exchanged via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments release on acceptance. Instant Book requires ID
verification; background checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are
city‑gated behind feature flags. Admin Console enforces least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and full audit trails.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Prepare for high‑impact, low‑probability events with rehearsed drills
and clear command.<br />
• Coordinate public communications that are honest, timely, and
user‑centric.<br />
• Recover quickly while preserving evidence and trust.</p>
<p>Risk statements (top of mind):<br />
• Data exfiltration of PII; public leak.<br />
• Payments freeze (processor outage); delayed payouts; mass
refunds.<br />
• Content policy crisis with press amplification.<br />
• Law‑enforcement emergency request mishandled or leaked.<br />
• Tax miscollection discovered post‑fact with state inquiry.</p>
<p>Primary causes &amp; contributing factors:<br />
• Zero‑day exploit or human error; inadequate segmentation; weak secrets
management.<br />
• Single point of failure; webhook lag; missing fallbacks.<br />
• Edge moderation cases; inconsistent enforcement; unclear
examples.<br />
• Poor intake; inadequate counsel coordination; staff
inexperience.<br />
• Allowlist gaps; mapping errors; missed reconciliation signals.</p>
<p>Leading indicators &amp; early warning signals:<br />
• SIEM alerts; unusual export volumes; media contact; external
researcher reports.<br />
• Checkout failures; payout backlog; angry tickets; social
mentions.<br />
• Reporter inquiries; creator backlash; surge in appeals.<br />
• LEA emails; urgent calls; subpoenas without proper service.<br />
• State notices; reconciliation variances; user complaints about
taxes.</p>
<p>Preventive controls &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Zero‑trust posture; RBAC/JIT; secrets rotation; backups; drills.<br />
• Multi‑processor readiness; ACH fallback; status page; clear banners;
queue resilience.<br />
• Examples gallery; Safe‑Mode; training; appeals path; PR
playbook.<br />
• LEA intake process; counsel oversight; audit trails; emergency
disclosure policy.<br />
• Tax engine allowlists; nightly reconciliation; corrective memos;
disclosure templates.</p>
<p>Incident playbooks (summary):<br />
• Breach response: contain, assess, notify as required; public
statement; long‑term hardening.<br />
• Processor incident: prefer ACH; pause promos; display banners;
proactive emails on payouts.<br />
• Policy crisis: consistent enforcement; examples; supportive tone;
moderator QA; appeal volume handling.<br />
• LEA mishandling: internal review; reinforce process; counsel‑approved
messaging; training refreshers.<br />
• Tax exposure: compute liability; consult counsel; amend receipts;
communicate refunds or charges.</p>
<p>RACI / Owners:<br />
• Incident Commander (IC), Security lead, Payments PM, Trust lead,
Legal/PR, Finance, SRE.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; success metrics:<br />
• MTTA/MTTR; user sentiment; incident recurrence; post‑mortem action
completion; legal response times.</p>
<p>Thresholds &amp; triggers (Go/No‑Go, rollback, escalation):<br />
• Sev‑0 declared when user PII confirmed exposed or checkout is broadly
down; Sev‑1 for prolonged partial outages.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; assumptions:<br />
• §10.7 incident drills; §8 legal policies; §4.12 money; vendor SLAs;
status page.</p>
<p>Acceptance checklist (risk under control when):<br />
□ Drills completed; comms templates approved; status page playbook
tested; evidence capture process verified.</p>
<p>Scenario Deep‑Dive — Public breach disclosure window:<br />
Context: Regulatory deadlines and user expectations collide.<br />
Trigger: Counsel advises notification deadlines approaching.<br />
Immediate actions: Draft statement; notify affected users; coordinate
with vendors; implement mitigations; open FAQ.<br />
Communication: Honest, user‑centric; no speculation; link to resources;
provide credit monitoring if appropriate.<br />
Rollback/Forward: N/A; focus on long‑term hardening and transparency
report.<br />
Owner: IC + Legal/PR | Telemetry: notification_sent, MTTR | Evidence:
Forensic logs; vendor statements; audit trails</p>

<p>Section 12 — Roadmap &amp; Phased Delivery (12.0–12.10)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:33:51 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section is a ≥2,500‑word internal roadmap chapter aligned
with Sections 1–11.</p>
<p>§12.0 — Roadmap Principles &amp; Themes (Trust‑First, Reversible,
Measurable)</p>
<p>§12.0 — Roadmap Principles &amp; Themes (Trust‑First, Reversible,
Measurable)</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• Applies across all phases; updated quarterly after 7/30/90‑day
reviews.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Ship trust‑critical features early; avoid scaling without safety and
money readiness.<br />
• Prefer reversible, city‑gated changes; use flags and holdouts for
anything that touches ranking or money.<br />
• Instrument everything; decisions follow data from §5 dashboards, not
anecdotes.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Trust‑First UX: IDV→Instant Book, Safe‑Mode default, clear
deliverables manifest, transparent fees.<br />
• Fair Discovery: relevance first; paid boosts capped, labeled, and
eligibility‑gated.<br />
• Creator Earnings: faster time‑to‑first booking; simple change‑orders;
clear travel fees; Early Payout (per‑use).<br />
• Operational Excellence: admin operability; two‑person approvals;
immutable audits; status page discipline.<br />
• City‑by‑City: runbooks, founding perks, local studios and ambassadors,
metrics gates.<br />
• Sustainable Monetization: take‑rate first; usage‑based promotions;
defer subscriptions until liquidity is proven.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Profiles &amp; Search (role‑aware, social metrics, presets).<br />
• Booking &amp; Money (escrow, change orders, travel fees, tax engine
allowlists).<br />
• Messaging &amp; Collaboration (threads, file manifests,
checklists).<br />
• Trust &amp; Safety (IDV/BG, moderation, Safe‑Mode, appeals).<br />
• Promotions (CPC/Featured v1 with caps, QS, holdouts).<br />
• Studios (phase‑gated, deposit rules, house rules, verified
badge).<br />
• Analytics &amp; Admin (dashboards, flags, incident drills).</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.idv.instant_book, feature.promotions.v1, feature.studio.beta,
feature.group_checkout, feature.lbg_receipt, city.{HOU,DAL,AUS}
allowlists.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• Vendors: processor(s), ACH, tax engine, IDV, BG, e‑signature, comms.
Internal: §5 data; §4 admin; §8 policy; §10 playbooks.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Over‑scope early phases; promotions perceived as pay‑to‑win; tax
misconfig; moderation backlog; processor outage.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• S→I, I→B, time‑to‑first booking, dispute loss rate, payout latency,
IDV %, Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS, no‑results rate, tax
variance.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Every phase has go/no‑go gates signed by Product, Trust, Finance, and
SRE.<br />
✓ Help‑center parity with UI; admin tools cover top 3 edge cases.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• Phase‑linked squads: Profiles/Search, Booking/Money, Trust/Safety,
Promotions/Growth, Studios, Platform/SRE, Data, Support/City Ops.</p>
<p>Milestones &amp; Checkpoints:<br />
• Quarterly roadmap review; monthly risk register review; flag audits;
city expansion checkpoint meetings.</p>
<p>Implementation Notes:<br />
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to 'off'
in new cities.<br />
• Admin Operability: No workstream is 'done' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Copy &amp; Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.<br />
• QA &amp; Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.<br />
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.<br />
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics
catalog.<br />
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.<br />
• Security &amp; Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for
sensitive admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.<br />
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.<br />
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.</p>

• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to 'off'
in new cities.<br />
• Admin Operability: No workstream is 'done' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Copy &amp; Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.<br />
• QA &amp; Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.<br />
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.<br />
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics
catalog.<br />
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.<br />
• Security &amp; Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for
sensitive admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.<br />
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.<br />
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.</p>

<p>§12.1 — Phase 0 (Pre‑Alpha): Scaffolding, Schemas, Admin, Policy</p>
<p>§12.1 — Phase 0 (Pre‑Alpha): Scaffolding, Schemas, Admin, Policy</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• T‑90 to T‑45 days before Alpha invite (internal &amp; selected
creators).</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Stand up core data schemas and events; ensure Admin Console MVP
supports support/trust workflows.<br />
• Draft policy and help content aligned to product scope (artistic‑only
public, Safe‑Mode default).<br />
• Select vendors (processor(s), ACH, tax, IDV/BG, e‑signature, comms)
and wire sandbox integrations.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Get the foundation right: data, admin, identity, money contracts, and
reversible flags.<br />
• Internal dogfooding with synthetic bookings to validate core loop and
receipts.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Data models: users, roles, service profiles, packages, bookings
(legs), payments, receipts, promotions, audits.<br />
• Events: search, inquiry, booking request, acceptance, change order,
deliverables manifest, acceptance, payout queued/sent, disputes.<br />
• Admin MVP: support refunds/amendments, content redaction,
impersonate/view‑as, audits.<br />
• Policy drafts: ToS, Privacy, Content/Safety; examples gallery for
artistic‑only and Safe‑Mode.</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.booking.core, feature.messaging.core, feature.admin.mini,
feature.tax.allowlist=false (sandbox), feature.idv.sandbox.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• Engineering environment, CI/CD, feature flag system, observability
stack (§5.12), ticketing (Support/Trust).</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Schema churn; admin gaps; unclear policy copy; vendor SLA
surprises.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• Synthetic loop pass rate; admin task completion without engineering;
staging stability; event completeness to Gold.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Core loop passes end‑to‑end in staging; admin can amend receipts and
issue refunds; policy drafts ready for counsel review.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• Founding Eng squad; Data engineer; Product/Design; Support/Trust
liaisons; Legal consult; SRE.</p>
<p>Milestones &amp; Checkpoints:<br />
• Schema freeze; admin MVP; sandbox vendors functioning; policy and help
drafts staged.</p>

Escrow, Messaging</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• T‑45 to T‑0; internal + small cohort (≤150 creators/buyers).</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Validate the core loop with real users in a controlled cohort; collect
usability feedback.<br />
• Enable role‑specific profiles and search presets; keep filter UI
simple with an advanced drawer.<br />
• Operationalize escrow, deliverables manifests, and acceptance flows;
enforce Safe‑Mode on public surfaces.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Minimum lovable product for discovery and booking; admin operability
before scale.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Role tabs; separate reviews per role; portfolio uploads with
tagging/approvals; social metrics chips (verified if connected).<br />
• Search presets (e.g., 'Fashion model in Houston this week'); advanced
filter drawer; verified‑only toggle.<br />
• Booking requests, acceptance, change orders; deliverables manifest
(lightweight) with external link manifest capture.<br />
• Messaging threads with file gating; reschedule within rules;
notifications; read receipts (optional).</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.search.presets, feature.reviews.by_role,
feature.manifest.external_only, feature.messaging.read_receipts.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• IDV vendor in sandbox; escrow on processor; ACH sandbox; help‑center;
admin refund calculator.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Overly complex filters; manifest intimidation; messaging misuse;
off‑platform leakage.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• S→I and I→B in cohort; manifest completion rate; off‑platform warning
triggers; response time; support tickets by category.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ S→I ≥ 15%; I→B ≥ 25% within cohort; admin resolves top 10 issues
without engineering; Safe‑Mode effective; no Sev‑1s.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />

<p>§12.4 — Phase 3 (GA — Houston): Promotions v1, Tax Allowlist, Early
Payout (Per‑Use)</p>
<p>§12.4 — Phase 3 (GA — Houston): Promotions v1, Tax Allowlist, Early
Payout (Per‑Use)</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• T+90 to T+150 (post‑beta, same city).</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Turn on promotions v1 with caps and holdouts; prove ≥2.5× ROAS without
harming organic search.<br />
• Stabilize money ops: ACH discount live; tax allowlist expanded where
ready; Early Payout per‑use live for high‑rep providers.<br />
• Harden safety and admin workflows for scale.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Add monetization carefully; keep fairness and trust standards
intact.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Search Boost (CPC floors by role/city) + Featured (weekly) with
labels, caps, QS, and holdouts; invalid‑click auto‑credits.<br />
• Payments &amp; tax: ACH discount messaging; allowlist expansion (if
ready); amended receipts; daily close automation.<br />
• Early Payout per‑use (eligibility Rep ≥ 85 + IDV); reserve rules;
payout ledger improvements.<br />
• Safety: harassment tooling, doxxing macro, stricter rate limits for
new accounts; appeals capacity.</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.promotions.v1, feature.early_payout,
feature.tax.allowlist.{more_states}, feature.payout.reserve.rules.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• Growth analytics; finance dashboards; Trust staffing; support macros;
status page templates.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Pay‑to‑win perception; invalid clicks; tax variance; payout queue
stuck; support overload.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• Promotions adoption; ROAS; invalid‑click credit %; organic KPIs
steady; payout latency; tax variance; support SLA.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ ROAS median ≥ 2.5×; organic KPIs steady; daily close green 14 days;
Early Payout error rate ≤ target.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• Growth PM, Finance, Payments Eng, Trust, Support, Data, SRE.</p>
<p>Milestones &amp; Checkpoints:<br />
• GA announcement; case studies; Featured carousels; ROAS report;
partner recap.</p>

<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• T+150 to T+240.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Replicate Houston GA playbook in Dallas and Austin with measured spend
and PR.<br />
• Prepare Studios Beta (verification, house rules, deposit defaults) for
a limited cohort.<br />
• Ensure cross‑city data comparability; maintain flag discipline.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Scale predictably; avoid overextending; test studios with narrow
scope.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• City turn‑up runbooks; founding perks; featured carousels; referral
codes via partner studios.<br />
• Studio verification flow (doc upload + light review); house rules
template library; deposit holds; check‑in/out surfaces.<br />
• LBG scaffolding (internal): dual‑leg receipts off; group bundling
experiments (behind flags only).</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• city.DAL allowlist, city.AUS allowlist, feature.studio.beta=false,
feature.lbg.scaffold=true (internal only).</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• City ops staff; studio partner pipeline; legal review of house rules;
deposit capture on processor.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Supply thin pockets; PR backlash; deposit misuse; studio disputes;
throughput on support.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• City S→I/I→B; supply coverage heatmaps; studio attach rate; deposit
claims; dispute rate for studio bookings.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />

<p>§12.7 — Phase 6: Mobile Apps (iOS/Android) &amp; Partner API
(Rate‑Limited)</p>
<p>§12.7 — Phase 6: Mobile Apps (iOS/Android) &amp; Partner API
(Rate‑Limited)</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• T+300 to T+390 (after multi‑city GA).</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Deliver mobile apps that improve conversion (notifications,
availability, messaging) without diverging product logic.<br />
• Expose a limited partner API for brands and studios under strict
scopes and rate limits.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Meet users where they are; keep parity with web; maintain safety and
fairness controls.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• iOS/Android apps: login/IDV, search, profiles, booking, messaging,
deliverables manifest review, notifications, wallet; deep links.<br />
• Push notifications with quiet hours; granular controls;
safety‑respecting previews.<br />
• Partner API: read‑only search &amp; profile data; RFP creation;
webhooks for booking state; OAuth scopes; rate limits; abuse
monitoring.</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.mobile.apps.beta=true (invite), feature.api.partner.read=true
(whitelist).</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• Mobile CI/CD; app store policies; privacy reviews; push infra; OAuth
provider; abuse detection.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Notification fatigue; API misuse; mobile parity gaps; app review
delays.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• Mobile activation; response time; bookings initiated on mobile;
notification opt‑outs; API error/abuse rates.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Mobile NPS ≥ web; parity for core flows; API clients pass compliance;
abuse anomaly rates low.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• Mobile engineers; API/backend; Security; SRE; Product; Design;
Support.</p>
<p>Milestones &amp; Checkpoints:<br />
• Beta → GA for apps; first partner integrations; API documentation
stable.</p>

<p>§12.8 — Phase 7: Technical Debt, Performance &amp; Quality Gates</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• Runs continuously; major focus windows after each GA.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Keep reliability, security, performance, and data quality within SLOs
while the roadmap evolves.<br />
• Pay down structural debt and keep dependencies current.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Stability as a feature; invest in platform health to sustain
growth.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Performance SLOs for search/messaging/checkout; budgets enforced in
CI; profiling and regressions tracked.<br />
• Observability: logs/metrics/traces; error budgets; incident
retrospectives; runbooks updated.<br />
• Security posture: secrets rotation; dependency updates; vulnerability
scans; pentest remediation.<br />
• Data quality: freshness, completeness, correctness checks; lineage;
rollback procedures.</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• feature.perf.budgets, feature.logs.traces, feature.security.scanner,
feature.data.dq.gates.</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• SRE platform; security tooling; data platform; team time allocation;
leadership commitment.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Feature pressure crowds out quality; silent regressions; security
drift; data incidents affecting finance.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• SLO compliance; incident counts and MTTA/MTTR; vuln backlog age; DQ
gate pass rates; perf budget adherence.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ Error budgets green ≥ 80% of quarters; no Sev‑0 from preventable
causes; DQ gates pass with exceptions documented.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• SRE; Platform; Security; Data; Product owners accountable for quality
alongside features.</p>

• Quarterly hardening sprints; dependency upgrade days; pentest
completion; DQ audit sign‑offs.</p>

<p>§12.10 — Phase Gates, KPIs &amp; Exit Criteria (Go/No‑Go per Phase
&amp; City)</p>
<p>§12.10 — Phase Gates, KPIs &amp; Exit Criteria (Go/No‑Go per Phase
&amp; City)</p>
<p>Roadmap Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document. Dates are
placeholders and will firm up as Section 5 telemetry validates
conversion and quality gates. All items ship behind flags and city
allowlists. Nothing herein creates external commitments.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only creative marketplace;
subscription‑free at launch; monetization via take‑rate and usage‑based
promotions with eligibility gates and strict caps; public content
limited to artistic‑only (guest Safe‑Mode on by default); deliverables
handled via external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests;
escrowed payments released on acceptance; Instant Book gated by ID
verification; optional background checks confer Trusted Pro; city‑gated
rollout with feature flags; strong Admin Console with least‑privilege,
JIT elevation, two‑person approvals, and immutable audits.</p>
<p>Timeframe &amp; Scope:<br />
• Applies to all phases; reviewed monthly; ratcheted only after
sustained performance.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Make phase transitions objective and auditable with clear,
city‑specific thresholds.<br />
• Avoid premature scaling; unlock hiring and spend based on
evidence.</p>
<p>Product Themes:<br />
• Evidence‑based progress; city‑gated rollouts; fairness and trust
non‑negotiable.</p>
<p>Workstreams &amp; Deliverables:<br />
• Define phase gates for Alpha, Beta, GA, and city expansions; publish
in Admin; tie to flags.<br />
• Create board‑level KPI pack (§9.8) with red/yellow/green bands and
owners.</p>
<p>Feature Flags &amp; City Gates:<br />
• gate.alpha.exit, gate.beta.exit, gate.ga.entry,
gate.city.expand.{city}, gate.promotions.on</p>
<p>Dependencies &amp; Inputs:<br />
• §5 dashboards; §10 drills; §11 risks; §9 financials; §8 policies.</p>
<p>Top Risks &amp; Mitigations:<br />
• Threshold myopia; metric gaming; noisy early data; city differences
ignored.</p>
<p>Instrumentation &amp; KPIs:<br />
• Per phase: S→I, I→B, repeat %, dispute loss, payout latency, IDV %,
Trusted Pro %, promotions ROAS (if on), support SLA, tax variance.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria (Go/No‑Go):<br />
✓ All gates green for the period; no Sev‑0/1; help‑center parity; admin
coverage for edge cases; board sign‑off for expansions.</p>
<p>Staffing &amp; Ownership:<br />
• City GM, Product, Trust, Finance, SRE, Data — each signs their
gate.</p>
<p>Milestones &amp; Checkpoints:<br />
• Alpha exit; Beta entry; GA entry; City‑2/3 launches; promotions GA;
studios beta/GA; mobile GA.</p>

• Security &amp; Privacy: PII masked by default; JIT elevation for
sensitive admin actions; vendor scopes minimal; audits immutable.<br />
• City Readiness: City‑first artifacts (press kit, creator ambassadors,
studio partners) prepared in §10.1 runbook.<br />
• Post‑Launch: 7/30/90‑day reviews convert observations into roadmap
changes; flags let us tune by city without forks.</p>
<p>Implementation Notes:<br />
• Flag Discipline: Each capability ships behind a named flag with a
runbook, owner, rollback, and blast‑radius notes. Flags default to 'off'
in new cities.<br />
• Admin Operability: No workstream is 'done' until admin tools enable
Support/Trust/Finance to handle the top 3 edge cases without
engineering.<br />
• Copy &amp; Policy: All flows have help‑center articles and email/SMS
templates; copy avoids legalese and links to policy examples.<br />
• QA &amp; Drills: Staging mimics production data shapes; drills include
processor/tax outages, moderation surges, and incident command
handoffs.<br />
• Experimentation: Features that affect marketplace economics (ranking,
boosts, fees) include holdouts and guardrails; we measure incremental
impact.<br />
• Data Wiring: Events land in Bronze/Silver/Gold (§5); KPIs pull only
from Gold with freshness SLOs. Definitions live in a metrics
catalog.<br />
• Accessibility: New UI complies with WCAG 2.1 AA; screen‑reader and
keyboard paths verified; contrast ratios checked; defects triaged.<br />

<p>Section 13 — Partnerships &amp; Ecosystem (13.0–13.7)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:42:25 UTC</p>
<p>Each sub‑section is a ≥2,500‑word partner strategy chapter aligned
with Sections 1–12.</p>
<p>§13.0 — Partnership Strategy &amp; Evaluation Framework</p>
<p>§13.0 — Partnership Strategy &amp; Evaluation Framework</p>
<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Define how we choose, integrate, and scale partners without
compromising trust or flexibility.<br />
• Prioritize partners that accelerate conversion (ACH, IDV), safety (BG,
studios), and differentiation (social metrics, RFPs).<br />
• Set common legal, security, and commercial patterns to speed
negotiation and onboarding.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• Money stack partners: processors, ACH, tax engines, payout
banks.<br />
• Trust stack partners: ID verification, background checks, e‑signature,
moderation tooling.<br />
• Discovery &amp; data partners: social platforms, analytics providers,
SEO/media affiliates.<br />
• Supply partners: verified studios, equipment rental, education
programs, creator communities.<br />
• Demand partners: brands, agencies, RFP aggregators, small‑business
networks.<br />
• Workflow partners: file storage (Drive/Dropbox), calendar, chat/Slack,
Zapier‑style automation.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Faster, cheaper, safer transactions → better conversion and margins
(ACH discounts, stable payouts).<br />
• Higher safety signals → more Instant Book, fewer disputes, better
trust and reviews.<br />
• Richer discovery (verified social metrics) → better matching, higher
booking value.<br />
• Lower CAC via co‑marketing (studios, schools, brand networks) →
cheaper city launches.<br />
• Improved retention via tools users already use (Drive, Dropbox,
Calendar, Slack).</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Security posture (SOC, pentest, breach history), data minimization,
token scopes, deletion flows.<br />
• Commercial flexibility (no exclusivity, volume tiers, credits for
outages, predictable pricing).<br />
• API quality and rate limits; reliability; sandbox support; SDKs;
webhooks.<br />
• Legal friendliness (DPAs, FCRA support for BG, clear liability
boundaries).<br />
• Cultural alignment: creator‑friendly, brand‑safe, responsive
support.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• Wallet/payment: card, ACH, refund, payouts; tax quotes; receipts
hooks.<br />
• Trust: IDV widgets, BG consent flows, FCRA notices; e‑signature for
SOW/releases.<br />
• Discovery: social platform connects; metrics ingestion; verified
chips.<br />
• Workflow: Drive/Dropbox file manifests; ICS calendar sync;
Slack/Zapier notifications.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Standard: pay‑as‑you‑go per‑use fees (IDV/BG); processor % rates; tax
quote per‑call; e‑signature per envelope.<br />
• Volume tiers after city 2–3; uptime credits; no minimums in year 1 if
possible.<br />
• Co‑marketing exchanges: logo placement, landing pages, co‑webinars,
city PR mentions.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Technical: feature flags, city allowlists, fallback paths, incident
runbooks.<br />
• Go‑to‑market: co‑branded pages, case studies, launch kits for
studios/schools/brands.<br />
• Support &amp; Trust: macros and escalation paths; quarterly business
reviews with vendors.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Vendor lock‑in; scope creep; privacy risk; cost overrun; PR
misalignment.<br />
• City‑specific regulatory quirks; rate‑limit throttling; API
regressions.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Vendor outage → roll to fallback; banner comms; reconcile later;
post‑incident credits.<br />
• API change → freeze flag; version pin; contact vendor; hotfix; staged
re‑enable.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Head of Partnerships (DRI), Legal, Security/SRE, Product owners
(Money/Trust/Search), City Ops.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Partner‑attributed conversion lift; ACH share; IDV completion; Trusted
Pro adoption; studio attach; RFP response rates.<br />
• Cost‑to‑serve per booking by partner; uptime; incident counts;
co‑marketing leads.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ Playbooks and fallback paths tested; DPA/SLA signed; partner flags
live in staging and one city; dashboards attribute lift.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Quarterly partner pipeline review; 30‑day pilot → 60‑day evaluation →
GA or deprecate.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Partner PR misalignment:<br />
Trigger: Partner promotes explicit content conflicting with our
artistic‑only stance.<br />
Response: Pause co‑marketing; reassess; require alignment statement;
restrict surfaces if needed.<br />
Legal/Comms: Neutral public stance; safety‑first messaging; internal
guidance.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Restore surfaces after alignment; otherwise sunset
integration.<br />
Owner: Head of Partnerships + Trust/Legal | Telemetry: brand sentiment,
creator complaints | Evidence: Screenshots, partner campaigns, policy
docs</p>
<p>Implementation Notes:<br />
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy &amp; Data: Apply least‑data
principles—only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate tokens;
revoke access on inactivity. • Security &amp; Audits: Vendor SOC/pentest
reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges pre‑arranged for
Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after pilots prove
value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone with our
artistic‑only policy. • Support &amp; Playbooks: Create partner‑specific
macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log incidents with
partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in §5 dashboards
(e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by provider, studio
attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid exclusivity unless
compensated; require termination rights, data return/delete clauses, and
uptime credits for SLA misses. • City Sequencing: Some partners launch
in founding cities only; we gate by city to manage operational
readiness. • Accessibility &amp; Inclusion: Ensure partner widgets meet
WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and keyboard navigation.<br />
• Ethics &amp; Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict
with user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in
intake.</p>

approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Stabilize checkout and payouts with best‑in‑class rails; reduce costs
with ACH; keep tax correct with allowlists.<br />
• Ensure reversibility with multi‑processor readiness and clear
fallbacks.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• Primary processor (card + escrow + payouts); backup processor
(failover).<br />
• ACH partner (bank linking, returns handling); payout bank for fast
transfers.<br />
• Tax engine for US‑only allowlists; receipt itemization; refund/credit
memos.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Higher checkout success; lower processor costs via ACH; predictable
payouts improve supply retention.<br />
• Tax correctness reduces support noise and financial exposure.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Card + 3DS support; dispute webhooks; idempotent APIs; strong uptime
SLAs.<br />
• ACH verification options (instant + micro‑deposits); returns codes;
fee transparency.<br />
• Tax engine coverage by state/city; latency; sandbox; post‑outage
reconciliation.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• Checkout: card auth/capture, ACH debit, split fees; escrow ledger;
refunds; receipts.<br />
• Payouts: bank connect (KYC/KYB); reserves; Early Payout; failure
retry; ledger export.<br />
• Tax: quote at checkout; amended receipts; deposit taxation for studios
later.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Interchange‑plus or blended %; ACH per‑debit fee; volume tiers after
City 2; uptime credits.<br />
• Tax engine per‑call pricing; annual plan negotiated after
stability.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Sandbox QA matrices; synthetic test cards and ACH returns; outage
drills; status page hooks.<br />
• Buyer ACH discount messaging; deposit vs charge line items; daily
close reconciliation playbook.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Processor outage; ACH returns spike; tax misquote; payout queue
stuck.<br />
• Vendor lock‑in and unexpected price increases.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Switch to fallback processor; prefer ACH; pause promos; reconcile
after.<br />
• Allowlist bypass for affected state taxes; amend post‑recovery;
transparent user messaging.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Payments PM/Eng, Finance, Tax PM, SRE, Support.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Checkout success; ACH adoption; payout latency; settlement variance;
tax quote success/latency; dispute win rate.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ 14 days of green daily close; staged rollout in one city; outage drill
passed; ACH share ≥ target.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Pilot in Houston alpha/beta; enable in Dallas/Austin after GA
stability; quarterly renegotiation checkpoints.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — ACH incentive confusion:<br />
Trigger: Buyer fee complaints despite ACH link.<br />
Response: Clarify UI copy; ensure fee reduction applied only on
successful ACH; add help‑center article.<br />
Legal/Comms: In‑checkout tooltip; follow‑up email, support macro.<br />

<p>§13.2 — Identity Verification, Background Checks &amp; E‑Signature
Partners</p>
<p>§13.2 — Identity Verification, Background Checks &amp; E‑Signature
Partners</p>
<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Increase Instant Book eligibility safely with high IDV completion and
optional BG checks; reduce dispute and safety incidents.<br />
• Enable compliant e‑signature for SOW/releases without leaving the
platform.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• IDV providers (document + selfie checks); BG providers with FCRA
workflows; e‑signature vendors with embedded flows.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Trust lift → higher conversion; fewer impersonation scams; easier
dispute resolution with verified identity.<br />
• Seamless SOW/releases reduce friction and create better evidence for
chargebacks.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Accuracy/latency; liveness detection; edge case coverage (lighting,
IDs); re‑verification options.<br />
• FCRA compliance (pre‑adverse/adverse notices); adjudication portal;
dispute handling; audit logs.<br />
• Signature templates, API, webhook receipts, long‑term storage, and
hash verification.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• IDV modal, consent screens, retry flows; badges; 'verified‑only'
search filter.<br />
• BG consent; status messaging; Trusted Pro badge; reputation
integration.<br />
• E‑signature templates (SOW, releases), per‑booking envelopes; receipts
linkback.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Per‑check pricing with volume tiers; subsidies for founding city;
credits on false positives.<br />
• E‑signature per‑envelope or monthly pool; usage alerts.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Help‑center copy; sample SOW/release library; appeals instructions;
adverse action templates.<br />
• Macros for edge cases (name mismatches; re‑verification; BG
disputes).</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• False declines; user frustration; FCRA errors; cost overrun from high
retry rates.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Switch to lighter IDV threshold for non‑Instant Book use; maintain
stricter bar for IB.<br />
• Pause BG adjudication if legal notices misconfigured; fix templates;
resume.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Trust lead, Legal, Product (Trust), Support, Data.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• IDV completion; IB adoption; BG pass rate; adverse action timing
adherence; dispute rate changes.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ IDV and BG flows pass QA; legal templates reviewed; badges gated;
audit logs live; appeals working.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• IDV in Beta; BG rollout optional post‑beta; e‑signature in GA.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — IDV false‑positive cluster:<br />
Trigger: Completion drops; reports by specific device/OS<br />
Response: Vendor escalation; adjust thresholds; publish guidance; extend
retries.<br />
Legal/Comms: UI hints; support macro; status page if widespread.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Revert threshold; schedule root‑cause review.<br />
Owner: Trust/Product | Telemetry: idv_completion, retry_rate | Evidence:
Vendor logs, device/OS breakdown</p>

<p>Goals:<br />
• Create a curated network of verified studios and locations that
improve shoot safety and convenience.<br />
• Pilot studio features in a narrow cohort before broader expansion.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• Photography/video studios, co‑working creative spaces, community
college studios, reputable independent owners.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Easier location logistics; safer venues; cross‑promotion; bundled
offers with creators.<br />
• Studios gain inbound bookings from our buyer base; we gain supply and
co‑marketing.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Legitimate business presence (docs), safety features (access control),
clear house rules, insurance.<br />
• Responsiveness to verification and policy alignment.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• Studio verification flow; badge; search filter; house rules; deposit

• Studio calendar sync; host messaging; incident reporting; deposit
capture/void; receipts.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Standard take‑rate on studio leg when LBG later; initial pilot with
flat fees or rev‑share; deposit mechanics with no platform fee on
deposit capture.<br />
• Co‑marketing swaps; featuring in city carousels; referral
programs.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />

deposit FAQ.<br />
• Partner meetups; photo/video collateral for carousels; studio‑backed
creator promo days.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Deposit disputes; misaligned rules; safety incidents; host no‑shows;
double bookings.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Deposit claim review; evidence list; capture/partial capture rules;
appeals.<br />
• Host support: no‑show resolution, refunds, and rescheduling
guidance.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Studios PM, City Ops, Trust, Support, Finance.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Studio attach rate; dispute rate; deposit claim frequency and
outcomes; host/buyer NPS; repeat rate.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ 10–20 verified studios per city; rules and deposit defaults tested;
dispute kit functioning; SLAs stable.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Pilot in Houston at or after GA; expand to Dallas/Austin
post‑learners.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Deposit claim spike:<br />
Trigger: Claims &gt; threshold in a week<br />
Response: Audit evidence; coach hosts; tune defaults; improve
pre‑booking disclosures.<br />
Legal/Comms: Help updates; targeted emails to frequent claimants.<br />

claim_outcomes | Evidence: Photos, timestamps, chat logs</p>
<p>Implementation Notes:<br />
• Partner Governance: Maintain a single source of truth for partner
status (prospect, NDA, pilot, GA), contacts, contracts, scopes, and
SLAs. Tag all features behind partner flags and city gates to avoid
blast‑radius mistakes. • Privacy &amp; Data: Apply least‑data
principles—only request scopes needed for the user value; rotate tokens;
revoke access on inactivity. • Security &amp; Audits: Vendor SOC/pentest
reports stored with expiry reminders; incident bridges pre‑arranged for
Sev‑1/Sev‑0. • Co‑Marketing Discipline: Announce after pilots prove
value; enforce clear success metrics; align PR/brand tone with our
artistic‑only policy. • Support &amp; Playbooks: Create partner‑specific
macros; train Support/Trust on integration quirks; log incidents with
partner tags. • Measurement: Attribute partner impact in §5 dashboards
(e.g., ACH share by vendor, IDV completion rate by provider, studio
attach from verified partners). • Contracts: Avoid exclusivity unless
compensated; require termination rights, data return/delete clauses, and
uptime credits for SLA misses. • City Sequencing: Some partners launch
in founding cities only; we gate by city to manage operational
readiness. • Accessibility &amp; Inclusion: Ensure partner widgets meet
WCAG 2.1 AA; provide text alternatives and keyboard navigation.<br />
• Ethics &amp; Brand Safety: Decline partners whose practices conflict
with user safety or our policy posture; include an ethics review in
intake.</p>

<p>§13.4 — Brand &amp; Agency Partnerships (RFPs, Preferred Vendors,
Case Studies)</p>
<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Attract repeat buyers with RFP tools and preferred vendor lists.<br />
• Lower CAC via partner co‑marketing and showcase case studies.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• SMBs with recurring content needs; agencies; DTC brands; local
businesses; hospitality and real estate marketers.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Brands: curated supply, RFP broadcast, escrow, tax receipts, cost
centers, team notes.<br />
• Our platform: steady demand, higher GMV, co‑marketing reach, city
credibility.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Budget fit; creative categories; SLA expectations; legal/brand safety
requirements.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• RFP creation and broadcast; preferred vendor folders; invoice/PO
flows; cost centers; API hooks later.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• No subscription at launch; usage‑based RFP credits; potential volume
credits; co‑marketing exchanges.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Brand onboarding: brief templates; case study gallery; team training;
dedicated AM for &gt;$10k/mo spend.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Outsized support needs; discount pressure; scope creep; favoritism
perceptions.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Pilot with clear SLAs; report deck; mutually agreed KPIs; exit ramp if
not a fit.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Brand Partnerships lead, Growth, Support/AM, Legal.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• RFP volume; response quality/time; conversion rate; repeat spend;
CSAT; NPS.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ 3–5 anchor brands per city; RFP pipeline healthy; conversion ≥
targets; co‑marketing content live.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Begin in Beta with 2–3 brands; expand post‑GA; formalize AM tiering
later.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Brand requests 'pay‑to‑win':<br />
Trigger: Asks for undisclosed ranking priority<br />
Response: Decline; explain fairness policy; offer Featured slots with
labels and caps; educate on filters and RFPs.<br />
Legal/Comms: Written policy and one‑pager; internal alignment.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: N/A<br />
Owner: Brand lead | Telemetry: brand_satisfaction, provider_feedback |

<p>§13.5 — Social Platform &amp; Analytics Partners (IG/YT/TT/X/LinkedIn
+ Analytics Providers)</p>
<p>§13.5 — Social Platform &amp; Analytics Partners (IG/YT/TT/X/LinkedIn
+ Analytics Providers)</p>
<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Power verified social metrics, engagement filters, and growth trends
with official connections and compliant scopes.<br />
• Phase integration by feasibility and partner access, keeping link‑only
options where APIs are closed.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• Instagram/Meta for verified metrics; YouTube/Google; TikTok; X
(Twitter); LinkedIn (Pages or partner access).<br />
• Third‑party analytics providers with compliant aggregation; link‑only
for others.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Buyers get confidence in reach/engagement; providers differentiate
with verified chips.<br />
• Platform gains unique discovery features and reasons to connect
accounts (stickiness).</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• API scope minimalism; rate limits; clear policy; compliance with
platform terms; branding rules.<br />
• Ability to refresh nightly + manual refresh; fair use and quotas;
stability history.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• OAuth connects; fetch followers, ER, avg views; show verified chips;
trend sparklines.<br />
• Advanced metrics (phase 2) for connected accounts only; public
discovery within policy bounds.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Typically no direct fees; rate‑limit &amp; review constraints;
potential partner programs; compliance costs internal.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Clear 'why connect' copy; low‑friction OAuth; privacy info;
disconnect/self‑report options; verified‑only search toggle.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• API access changes; policy violations; misinterpretation of metrics;
rate‑limit induced outages.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Graceful degradation to self‑reported with 'unverified' label; cache
and backoff; communicate transparently.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Search/Data PMs; Legal; Security; Marketing for co‑marketing
approvals.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Connect rates; query usage for social filters; bookings uplift;
refresh success; support tickets on metrics.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ Verified chips working; nightly refresh within quotas; help content
clear; no policy violations.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Day‑1 IG/YT/TT/X; Phase‑2 LinkedIn if partner access; continuous
compliance reviews.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — API quota exhaustion:<br />
Trigger: Refresh jobs fail due to rate limits<br />
Response: Backoff; prioritize top accounts; expose manual refresh
limits; show stale data banner.<br />
Legal/Comms: Help‑center notice; in‑product tooltip.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable normal cadence after quota reset.<br />
Owner: Data/Search | Telemetry: refresh_success, quota_usage | Evidence:
Job logs; API responses</p>

<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Seed supply and cultivate best practices via education channels that
replenish the marketplace.<br />
• Offer safety training, portfolio reviews, and city meetups that build
trust and loyalty.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• University photo/video programs; community colleges; trade schools;
creator clubs; camera stores; meetup groups.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Students and emerging creators get paid experience and safety
scaffolds; schools get career outcomes.<br />
• We gain verified, trained supply and grassroots co‑marketing.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• Program legitimacy; faculty champions; safety posture; willingness to
co‑host trainings and meetups.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• Campus workshops: Safe‑Mode, deliverables manifest, contracts,
reputation; co‑hosted creator days in partner studios.<br />
• Referral codes; verified badges for program participants (non‑monetary
recognition).</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Non‑financial in most cases; mutual promotion; event co‑sponsorship;
limited grants for founding programs.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Campus starter kit; deck and curriculum; checklist for faculty; event
playbook; creator ambassador program.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Overhead vs. ROI; policy misunderstandings; reputational risk if
program faces controversy.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Pilot small; measure outcomes; keep content apolitical; focus on craft
and safety; pause if controversy arises.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Community lead, City Ops, Trust, Marketing.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Signups and activation from partner programs; time‑to‑first booking;
retention; safety incident rates among cohorts.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ At least 2 partner programs per city; workshops delivered; measurable
activation and safety improvements.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Begin in Houston beta; expand to Dallas/Austin; annual refresh of
materials.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Low activation from partner school:<br />
Trigger: Few bookings post‑workshop<br />
Response: Follow‑up coaching; pairing with studios; featured carousel
for graduates; refine curriculum.<br />
Legal/Comms: Newsletter spotlight; mentor program invitations.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Scale back if outcomes remain weak.<br />
Owner: Community lead | Telemetry: activation_rate,

<p>§13.7 — API &amp; Integration Partners (Zapier, Slack, Drive/Dropbox,
Calendar, CRM)</p>
<p>§13.7 — API &amp; Integration Partners (Zapier, Slack, Drive/Dropbox,
Calendar, CRM)</p>
<p>Partnerships Disclaimer: This is an internal planning document for
partner strategy and ecosystem development. It does not create
commitments. All integrations ship behind flags, follow privacy
policies, and require vendor due diligence, DPAs, SLAs, and legal
review. Commercial terms are illustrative until negotiated.</p>
<p>Context &amp; Alignment: US‑only marketplace at launch;
subscription‑free; monetization via take‑rate and capped,
eligibility‑gated usage‑based promotions. Public content is
artistic‑only with Safe‑Mode on for guests. Deliverables flow via
external links (Drive/Dropbox) with immutable manifests; escrow releases
on acceptance. Instant Book is gated by ID verification; background
checks are opt‑in (Trusted Pro). Rollouts are city‑gated behind feature
flags; Admin Console enforces least‑privilege, JIT elevation, two‑person
approvals, immutable audits, and kill‑switches.</p>
<p>Goals:<br />
• Let power users connect our marketplace to their workflows without
compromising safety or fairness.<br />
• Start with read‑oriented, narrow scopes; expand only after abuse and
privacy reviews.</p>
<p>Target partner segments:<br />
• Zapier/IFTTT; Slack/MS Teams; Google Drive/Dropbox;
Google/Apple/Outlook Calendar; Notion/Airtable; Mailchimp/HubSpot for
brands.</p>
<p>Mutual value proposition:<br />
• Automations reduce admin toil (e.g., copy bookings to calendar, notify
teams, archive deliverables manifests).<br />
• Brands integrate with their CRMs; providers streamline follow‑ups and
reviews.</p>
<p>Selection criteria &amp; due diligence:<br />
• OAuth scopes; per‑event webhooks; rate limits; strong ecosystem docs;
permissioning and audit logs.</p>
<p>Integration scopes &amp; surfaces (what we build):<br />
• Outbound webhooks for booking events; calendar sync; file manifest
export; Slack notifications; RFP broadcast hooks.<br />
• Inbound limited (e.g., RFP create from a brand system) with strict
validation and rate limits.</p>
<p>Commercial &amp; legal patterns (illustrative):<br />
• Most APIs free to integrate; paid plans for high call volumes; partner
directories for co‑listing.</p>
<p>Enablement &amp; co‑marketing (how we launch together):<br />
• Developer portal (later); sample zaps; Slack app with scoped
permissions; step‑by‑step guides; support forum.</p>
<p>Top risks &amp; mitigations:<br />
• Abuse via automations (spam); privacy leaks via over‑broad scopes;
rate‑limit exhaustion; shadow workflows creating support burden.</p>
<p>Operational playbooks (summary):<br />
• Throttle; per‑user caps; approval for certain zaps; audit logs;
automated abuse detection; revoke tokens on violations.</p>
<p>Owners &amp; RACI:<br />
• Platform PM/Eng, Security, Data, Support.</p>
<p>KPIs &amp; leading indicators:<br />
• Integration adoption; errors; rate‑limit hits; support tickets;
bookings attributed to integrations.</p>
<p>Acceptance criteria (ready / successful when):<br />
✓ Zaps and Slack app pass security review; scopes minimal; abuse anomaly
rates low; docs published.</p>
<p>Timeline &amp; checkpoints:<br />
• Post multi‑city GA; staged allowlists; developer portal beta
later.</p>
<p>Scenario Playbook — Slack app spam:<br />
Trigger: Automated DMs create spam complaints<br />
Response: Disable outbound DM event; require manual approval; limit to
channels; add rate caps.<br />
Legal/Comms: Changelog and help‑center updates; outreach to affected
users.<br />
Roll‑back/Forward: Re‑enable with stricter scopes after
mitigation.<br />
Owner: Platform PM/Security | Telemetry: spam_reports, rate_limit_hits |
Evidence: Webhook logs; Slack audit logs</p>

<p>Purpose<br />
This appendix standardizes the language and responsibilities used across
the plan. It prevents ambiguity across product, engineering, trust &amp;
safety, support, finance, legal, data, and city ops. It aligns directly
with Sections 1 (UX), 3 (Monetization), 4 (Architecture), 5 (Data), 8
(Policies), 10 (Launch), 11 (Risk), and 12 (Roadmap).</p>
<p>A1. Core Marketplace Terms (Plain‑English)</p>
<p>• **Buyer** — The party paying for a service (e.g., photographer
hiring a model, brand hiring a creator, or buyer booking a studio in
later phases). May be an individual or a business/brand account.</p>
<p>• **Provider / Seller / Talent** — A user offering services (model,
photographer, videographer, content creator). A single person can hold
multiple roles.</p>
<p>• **Studio Host** — A business or individual offering a physical
studio/location for shoots (phase‑gated).</p>
<p>• **Service Profile** — A role‑specific profile (e.g., 'Model',
'Photographer') under one account, each with its own packages,
availability, reviews, and pricing.</p>
<p>• **Package** — A priced bundle (time, scope, deliverables) a
provider offers. Buyers can add extras and licensing.</p>
<p>• **Instant Book** — Booking flow that does not require explicit
provider approval. Requires ID Verification; can be toggled by the
provider.</p>
<p>• **Escrow** — Funds held by the platform until
completion/acceptance; reduces fraud and enables dispute resolution.</p>
<p>• **Change Order** — A post‑acceptance modification to
date/time/scope/price, proposed by either party and accepted by the
other.</p>
<p>• **Deliverables Manifest** — A structured list of items the provider
commits to deliver (files, counts, formats). We store an immutable
external‑link manifest for evidence.</p>
<p>• **Acceptance Window** — Time after deliverables are posted for the
buyer to accept or raise issues before escrow releases
automatically.</p>
<p>• **LBG (Linked Booking Group)** — A multi‑leg booking (e.g., talent
+ studio) paid as one transaction with separate receipts.
Phase‑gated.</p>
<p>• **Reputation Score** — A 0–100 score derived from reviews,
reliability, responsiveness, verifications, and recent performance
(role‑aware, time‑weighted).</p>
<p>• **Verified/Trusted Pro** — Badges for ID‑verified users and
background‑checked users, respectively.</p>
<p>• **Promoted / Boosted** — Paid visibility units (capped, labeled,
eligibility‑gated). Never override relevance.</p>
<p>• **Safe‑Mode** — Default public content filter for guests. Public
surfaces allow only artistic‑grade content; explicit sexual content is
disallowed.</p>
<p>• **Boards** — Buyer’s saved shortlists of providers for a project.
Board sponsor (later) is a paid placement product.</p>
<p>• **RFP** — Request For Proposal—buyer broadcasts a brief to vetted
providers meeting filters.</p>
<p>• **Dispute** — Formal resolution process when either party contests
delivery, timeliness, or policy violations.</p>
<p>• **Support Case** — Ticket in the admin console tying user reports,
refunds, and moderation actions to a single timeline.</p>
<p>• **City Gate / Allowlist** — Feature flag and supply gating per city
to ensure measured rollouts and reversible changes.</p>

PO</p>
<p>A4. Term/Label Canon (UI vs Data vs Legal)</p>
<p>We maintain a canonical mapping of UI labels, data field names, and
legal language to avoid drift. Example:<br />
UI: 'Change Order' → Data: change_order_event → Legal: 'amendment'. UI:
'Buyer fee' → Data: buyer_fee_amt → Legal: 'Service fee'.</p>
<p>A5. Acceptance &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Owner: Product Ops. Review cadence: quarterly. Change control: PRD +
Slack #product‑ops; update Help Center and Admin copy on change.</p>

<p>Appendix B — Data Dictionary (Quick Reference to §5.5)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
This appendix is a field‑level quick reference for analysts and
engineers. The authoritative schema lives in the warehouse (Section 5).
This guide summarizes Fact and Dimension tables, keys, privacy tags,
freshness, and common joins, so product and support can communicate
unambiguously.</p>
<p>B1. Naming, Keys &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>Naming: snake_case for tables/columns. Facts store
events/transactions; Dimensions store entities/attributes.<br />
Keys: surrogate keys with id prefixes (user_id, booking_id). Foreign
keys explicit. Composite keys where necessary.<br />
Privacy tags: P0 (PII‑sensitive like TIN), P1 (contact), P2
(behavioral), P3 (public). Access controlled per §4.14.1.</p>
<p>B2. Core Dimensions</p>
<p>• **user_dim** — User account and global settings.<br />
Fields: user_id (PK), created_at_ts, email_hash (P1), phone_hash (P1),
country_code, state_code, city, role_flags, idv_status,
trusted_pro_status, rep_overall_score, deletion_status</p>
<p>• **service_profile_dim** — Role‑specific offerings.<br />
Fields: service_profile_id (PK), user_id (FK), role_type
('model'|'photographer'|'videographer'|'creator'), headline, rate_min,
rate_max, instant_book_enabled, nsfw_opt_in, studio_verified_flag,
rep_role_score</p>
<p>• **location_dim** — Geo lookup.<br />
Fields: location_id (PK), city, state_code, lat, lng, metro_area,
timezone</p>
<p>• **time_dim** — Calendar/time grain.<br />
Fields: time_id (PK), date, week, month, quarter, year, dow, hour</p>
<p>• **studio_dim (beta)** — Studios/hosts.<br />
Fields: studio_id (PK), owner_user_id (FK), name, address_hash (P1),
verified_flag, deposit_default_amt, house_rules_version</p>
<p>B3. Core Facts (Events/Transactions)</p>
<p>• **booking_fact** — One row per booking
request/acceptance/completion.<br />
Fields: booking_id (PK), buyer_user_id, provider_user_id,
service_profile_id, role_type, location_id, created_time_id, state
('requested'|'accepted'|'completed'|'disputed'|'canceled'),
subtotal_amt, travel_fee_amt, buyer_fee_amt, provider_fee_amt, tax_amt,
payment_method ('card'|'ach')</p>
<p>• **booking_leg_fact (LBG)** — One row per leg (talent/studio) in
group bookings.<br />
Fields: leg_id (PK), booking_id (FK), leg_type ('talent'|'studio'),
leg_subtotal_amt, leg_tax_amt, deposit_auth_amt, accept_time_id,
complete_time_id</p>
<p>• **payment_fact** — Charges/refunds.<br />
Fields: payment_id (PK), booking_id, charge_amt, refund_amt, processor,
3ds_flag, ach_flag, status</p>
<p>• **payout_fact** — Provider/host payouts.<br />
Fields: payout_id (PK), user_id, amount, reserve_withheld_amt,
reserve_released_amt, early_payout_fee_amt, status</p>
<p>• **tax_quote_fact** — Tax engine responses.<br />
Fields: tax_quote_id (PK), booking_id, state_code, jurisdiction_code,
quote_amt, latency_ms, success_flag</p>
<p>• **promotion_impression_fact** — Paid card impressions.<br />
Fields: impression_id (PK), service_profile_id, placement, qs_score,
bid_cpc, city, timestamp, buyer_session_id</p>
<p>• **promotion_click_fact** — Clicks on promoted cards.<br />
Fields: click_id (PK), impression_id (FK), ctr_position,
valid_click_flag, cpc_charged_amt</p>
<p>• **conversion_fact** — Inquiry/booking conversions attributed to
impressions.<br />

appeal_flag, final_decision</p>
<p>B4. Joins &amp; Common Queries</p>
<p>Examples: profile discovery funnel; promotions ROAS; dispute loss
rate; payout latency by role. Include sample SQL patterns and caution
about double counting.</p>
<p>B5. Freshness &amp; Quality SLOs</p>
<p>Gold tables freshness ≤ 15 min for events, ≤ 24h for aggregates. Data
quality gates: completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity.</p>
<p>B6. Ownership &amp; Change Control</p>
<p>Owners: Data team. Schema changes require RFC; version notes;
downstream impact analysis.</p>

<p>Appendix C — Policy Templates (SOW, Releases, House Rules, Adverse
Action)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
Provide neutral, plain‑English templates that users and staff can adopt.
These are not legal advice. They must be reviewed by counsel before
publication. Where FCRA applies (background checks), we include
pre‑adverse/adverse action letter templates and timing notes.</p>
<p>C1. SOW (Statement of Work) — Template</p>
<p>Sections: Parties; Date/Location; Scope; Deliverables (manifest);
Usage/License; Fees/Deposits; Changes/Overtime; Travel; Cancellations;
Safety &amp; Conduct; Confidentiality; Dispute Resolution;
Signatures.<br />
Notes: Keep role‑agnostic; insert exhibit for role specifics (e.g.,
photo retouch counts, video cuts).</p>
<p>C2. Model Release — Template</p>
<p>Plain‑English clauses: Consent; Scope of Use; Duration; Territory;
Compensation; Credit; Revocation limits; No moral rights; Safety; Age of
Majority declaration; Witness line. Includes fields to attach IDV
reference ID (not storing the ID itself in the document).</p>
<p>C3. Property/Studio Release — Template</p>
<p>Clauses: Permission to use premises; Areas allowed; Time windows;
Restrictions (nudity policy compliance); Insurance; Indemnity; Damages;
Deposit rules; House rules; Signatures.</p>
<p>C4. House Rules (Studio) — Template</p>
<p>Structure: Safety; Fire exits; No smoking/vaping; Sound limits;
Maximum occupancy; Cleanliness; Allowed props; Pet policy; Nudity
policy; Neighbor respect; Overtime fees; Deposit conditions; Contacts
for emergencies.</p>
<p>C5. FCRA Letters (Background Checks) — Templates</p>
<p>Pre‑Adverse Action: Notice, copy of report, summary of rights, time
to respond (e.g., 5 business days).<br />
Adverse Action: Final decision, reasons, reporting agency contact,
rights to dispute, no decision by agency disclaimer.<br />
Timing notes: Timer starts when user receives the notice; admin console
tracks deadlines (see §4.14.3).</p>
<p>C6. Publishing &amp; Versioning</p>
<p>Owner: Legal/Trust. Version control: numbered exhibits. City deltas:
callouts. Accessibility and plain‑language review required.</p>

<p>Appendix D — City Scoring Model (Expansion Readiness)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
Provide an objective method to evaluate new cities for expansion,
avoiding hype‑driven decisions. The model aligns with Section 2 GTM and
Section 12 roadmap gates. It produces a composite score with go/no‑go
recommendations, data sources, and staffing implications.</p>
<p>D1. Scoring Axes &amp; Weights (Example)</p>
<p>• **Supply Depth (30%)** — Active creators/providers per 10k
population; studio partners; education partners; social presence.</p>
<p>• **Demand Potential (25%)** — Local ad spend proxies; SMB density;
DTC presence; content‑hungry verticals.</p>
<p>• **Unit Economics (20%)** — CPC expectations; estimated take‑rate
GMV; tax complexity; payment costs.</p>
<p>• **Operational Readiness (15%)** — Moderator/Support availability;
local studio partners; legal comfort.</p>
<p>• **Competitive/PR (10%)** — Competitor presence; partnership
opportunities; press friendliness.</p>
<p>D2. Data Sources &amp; Collection</p>
<p>Internal: waitlists, signups, search traffic, conversion in adjacent
cities. External: census data, business registries, ad spend proxies,
social trend indices.</p>
<p>D3. Score Calculation &amp; Thresholds</p>
<p>Normalize each axis to 0–100; apply weights; composite score ≥ 70 →
consider Beta; 60–69 → nurture; &lt; 60 → defer. Add qualitative
notes.</p>
<p>D4. Decision Packet Template</p>
<p>One‑pager with score, map, supply heatmap, top partners, risks,
staffing, budget, PR plan, and a proposed launch window.</p>
<p>D5. Governance &amp; Review</p>
<p>Quarterly review; Section 11 risk sanity check; Section 9 budget
alignment; Section 10 playbook readiness.</p>
<p>Implementation Notes:<br />
• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.<br />
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.<br />
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.<br />
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.<br />
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.<br />
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.<br />
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
'how to use this' section for Support/Trust.<br />
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.</p>

<p>Appendix E — Revenue Recognition Notes &amp; Fee Math Examples (ties
to §3.1)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
Document how platform fees are recognized under a marketplace model, how
refunds and adjustments are treated, and provide clear numerical
examples that match receipts (§4.12) and fee engine rules (§3.1).
Coordinate with accounting counsel for GAAP compliance. This is not
accounting advice.</p>
<p>E1. Revenue Streams &amp; When Recognized</p>
<p>Provider fee (commission) — recognized at the point the service is
delivered and accepted (or auto‑accepted). Buyer service fee —
recognized at transaction processing; refunded on provider‑fault
cancellations per policy. Promotions revenue — recognized on delivery of
impressions/clicks or over the weekly term for Featured.</p>
<p>E2. Escrow, Refunds, Adjustments</p>
<p>Escrow liability sits until acceptance; change orders adjust the
contract value; refunds reduce recognized revenue if already recognized;
otherwise release liability.</p>
<p>E3. Worked Examples (Step‑by‑Step)</p>
<p>• **Example A** — Talent booking $600; buyer fee 5%; provider fee 12%
minus Instant Book 1% and Trusted Pro 0.5%; ACH used; show journal
entries for charge, escrow, acceptance, payout, fees.</p>
<p>• **Example B** — Change order +$100; acceptance delayed; buyer
cancels under rules; compute partial refund and fee impact.</p>
<p>• **Example C** — Dispute resulting in 30% refund post‑acceptance;
show revenue adjustment and payout clawback if applicable.</p>
<p>E4. Journal Entry Patterns (Illustrative)</p>
<p>Include debits/credits for cash, escrow liability, revenue (provider
fee, buyer fee), processor fees, promotions, refunds/chargebacks,
reserves, early payout fees.</p>
<p>E5. Reconciliation &amp; Controls</p>
<p>Daily close checklist; settlement variances; dispute fees; promotions
credits; tax memos.</p>
<p>E6. Acceptance &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Owner: Finance. Review cadence: monthly with Section 9; sync with
§4.12 ledger outputs and exports.</p>

<p>Appendix F — Tax Nexus Matrix Snapshot (ties to §4.12/§5.10)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
Provide the structure of our tax nexus and taxability matrix without
hard‑coding rates or legal conclusions. This appendix explains how the
matrix is maintained, how the tax engine allowlist works, and how
Support communicates tax outcomes. It is a guide, not legal advice.</p>
<p>F1. Matrix Structure (Template)</p>
<p>Columns: State; City/County; Taxability of services (talent, studio,
digital deliverables); Marketplace facilitator obligations; Sourcing
rule (origin/destination); Registration status; Effective date;
Notes/links. Values are maintained in Admin by Tax role and published to
the tax engine allowlist.</p>
<p>F2. Change Control &amp; Reviews</p>
<p>Quarterly review with counsel; engine sync logs; reconciliation
variances trigger investigation; audit trail stored in Admin
(§4.14.7).</p>
<p>F3. Support Macros &amp; Receipts Language</p>
<p>Plain‑English explainer for buyers: when and why taxes appear; ACH
discount messaging; amended receipt process for state‑level changes.</p>
<p>F4. Acceptance &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Owner: Tax &amp; Compliance. Acceptance: zero reconciliation
variances beyond tolerance; clear help‑center entries; training
complete.</p>

<p>Appendix G — Experiment Pre‑Registration Template (ties to §5.13)</p>
<p>Generated on 2025-11-04 23:53:44 UTC</p>
<p>Purpose<br />
Create a repeatable, auditable template for experiments that affect
discovery, pricing, messaging limits, or safety thresholds.
Pre‑registration reduces bias ('p‑hacking') and aligns teams on
guardrails and success criteria before launch.</p>
<p>G1. Template Fields</p>
<p>• **Title &amp; ID** — Experiment name and tracking ID.</p>
<p>• **Owner &amp; Reviewers** — Product, Data, Trust, Finance
sign‑offs.</p>
<p>• **Hypothesis** — Falsifiable statement including target segment and
expected direction of effect.</p>
<p>• **Primary Metrics** — Exactly one or two (e.g., S→I, I→B, dispute
loss rate). Defined in §5 catalog.</p>
<p>• **Guardrail Metrics** — Must not degrade (e.g., organic S→I, buyer
hide rate, safety reports, payout latency).</p>
<p>• **Population &amp; Randomization** — Eligibility, stratification
(city/role), unit of assignment, holdout size.</p>
<p>• **Sample Size &amp; Power** — Pre‑computed; expected duration with
traffic estimates.</p>
<p>• **Treatments** — What changes and what remains constant;
screenshots/copy.</p>
<p>• **Instrumentation** — Events, experiment bucketing, attribution
windows.</p>
<p>• **Analysis Plan** — Statistical tests, treatment of outliers,
sequential monitoring rules.</p>
<p>• **Stop/Extend/End Criteria** — Numerical thresholds; min runtime;
quality checks.</p>
<p>• **Rollout Plan** — Flags, cities, staged ramp, rollback recipe.</p>
<p>• **Comms Plan** — Internal release notes; help‑center changes;
external messaging if any.</p>
<p>• **Risks &amp; Ethics** — Identify bias risks, fairness, and user
harm; mitigation.</p>
<p>• **Post‑Mortem Checklist** — What worked, what didn’t, what to
productize.</p>
<p>G2. Example (Promotions Density Cap A/B)</p>
<p>Outline a worked example with metrics (ROAS ≥ 2.5×) and guardrails
(organic S→I no worse than −3%). Include holdout cell and city
gating.</p>
<p>G3. Storage &amp; Discoverability</p>
<p>All pre‑regs stored in the warehouse (Gold) and mirrored in the Admin
experiments registry; searchable by owner, city, and metric.</p>
<p>G4. Acceptance &amp; Ownership</p>
<p>Owner: Data Science. Acceptance: no experiment ships without a
pre‑reg; post‑mortems added within 7 days of completion.</p>

• Keep this appendix version‑controlled; link to the controlling owner
and next review date.<br />
• Align terminology with Section 1 UI labels and Section 5 metrics
catalog; avoid synonyms that confuse staff.<br />
• When examples include numbers, ensure they reconcile to Section 3.1
fee math and Section 4.12 receipts.<br />
• Accessibility: all templates should be usable with keyboard‑only
navigation and screen readers.<br />
• Privacy: avoid embedding real PII in examples; use placeholders
consistently.<br />
• City‑gates: where content varies by city, call out the delta
explicitly and tie to the corresponding feature flag.<br />
• Training: every appendix should have a 1‑page executive summary and a
'how to use this' section for Support/Trust.<br />
• Change control: every material change requires an entry in the
changelog, owner sign‑off, and a Slack announcement to the relevant
channel.</p>
